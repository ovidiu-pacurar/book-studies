PREFATORY
Judge J. F. Butherford,
Brooklyn, N". Y.
Dear Sir: The advance proof pages of your brochure, "Millions
ISTow Living Will Never Die/' which you kindly allowed me to read, have proved to be even more interesting than
hoped for, and I embrace this early opportunity to express to you my sincere appreciation of the work.
The admirable way in which you have marshalled
the sayings of the Lord Jesus, of the apostles, and of the prophets of old, and supported them by abundant
secular evidence, all going to show that a time would come when millions then living would never die—and
that we are now living in that time—will inspire hope
and confidence in the mind of every honest, truth- seeking reader. As the one who had the esteemed privilege of syndicating Pastor EusselFs sermons in thousands of newspapers- in many lands, I was naturally anxious to know
how you would treat the prophecies so often referred to in Pastor KusselTs sermons. I am glad, indeed, to note
that you treat the major part of your evidence from the
standpoint of fulfilled prophecy. For one, I am glad
that you gathered such an array of evidence to substantiate your claims and to show the people, as a basis for a worth-while hope, how they may live for ever. It will not be necessary for anyone to consider your
statements as a guess. Again thanking you and wishing you rich eternal
blessings for your labor of love, I subscribe myself as Yours in the best of bonds,G. C. Driscoll
Santa Monica, Calif., May 17, 1920.

Millions Now Living Will Never Die
HE emphatic announcement that millions
now living on earth will never die must seempresumptuous to many people ; but when the evidence is carefully considered I believe that
almost every fair mind will concede that the
conclusion is a reasonable one. For nearly nineteen hundred years Christians
have been looking forward to a time coming1 when life everlasting will be offered to all the
peoples of earth. Their expectations and hopeshave been based upon the combined testimonyof the inspired prophets of old—from Moses to
John—upon the testimony of Jesus of Nazareth,
the Son of the living God, and upon the testimony of his inspired apostles.
About 4,000 years ago God made a promiseto Abraham in which he said that he would bless
Abraham and through his seed all the families
of the earth should be blessed. Not only did hemake this promise, but he bound it with his
oath; and St. Paul plainly tells us that these
two things, God's word and oath, are unchangeable, and that his promises must be fulfilled. Based upon that oathbound promise and subsequent like promises made to the offspring of
Abraham, devout Jews of the world have since
looked forward to the time coming when bless5
6 Millions Noio Living Will Never Die
ings of life and happiness eternal will be offeredto mankind.
Today the eyes of orthodox Jews of earth arefixed upon Palestine. They are looking np andlifting np their heads and the hope is springinginto millions of hearts that the time is at handfor the regathering of the Jews to Palestineand the establishment there of a state or government of the Jews and for the Jews, accordingto the divine arrangement. Since the time of
Abraham they have looked for the Messiah,bnt have not yet discerned who constitutes the
Messiah.
Life everlasting in a state of happiness is the
greatest desire of all men. Whether men havefaith or not in the divine promises, each onewonld be glad to know for a certainty that there
was before him life everlasting in a happy state. In view of this strong desire, and of the cumulative evidence given by the holy men of old con- cerning such coming blessings, it seems strangethat more people have not tried to inform themselves upon the subject. The reason, as assignedby the Apostle Paul, is that "the god of this
world [Satan, the invisible ruler of the presentsocial order of things] hath blinded the mindsof those who are perishing, lest the glorious
glad tidings of Christ Jesus, who is the imageof God, should shine into their hearts".—2 Corinthians 4:4.
Many men of ability in the past centuries
have entered the Christian ministry. The great
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 7
adversary, knowing their vulnerable points, has
used others to flatter and cajole them and to
turn their minds toward worldly things, and
by far the greater number of these clergymen,
yielding to the baneful and seductive influence
of the adversary, have themselves turned awayfrom the Bible, and have blindly led the people
in the wrong direction. They seem to have lost
sight entirely of the fact that God has a great
plan which he is causing to work out in anorderly, majestic manner. But the hour has
struck when the people shall know the truth,
and they that know the truth shall be made free
from the bondage of ignorance and superstition
and their minds shall be turned into the channels
leading to unending joy.
It is the purpose of the writer to try to turn
the minds of the people to a careful and prayerful consideration of the divine promises. It is to be deeply regretted that the clergymen would
oppose an effort to teach the people the Bible
truths; nevertheless, we find much opposition
everywhere, and many clergymen will attempt to
prevent the people from reading what is here
written. We, therefore, assure the reader that
we have no ulterior motive in putting out this
message. It is not propaganda. There is no
desire nor effort to induce the reader to join
anything. The motive for this publication is wholly unselfish. The writer has but one desire
and that is to induce the people to read and rely
upon the divine promises and thus fix their
S Millions Noid Living Will Never Die
hearts and minds in this hour of distress uponmankind ; to comfort those that mourn and point
them to a better day "which is near at hand.
We should have in mind that the great, all- wise Creator has been now for more than 4,000
years dealing with certain people, preparatory
to bringing to every man an opportunity for
life everlasting. If he whose wisdom is perfect
would devote so much time and energy to the
outworking of a great plan, then surely it is worthy of the careful and painstaking examination and consideration of every man, without
regard to his creed, religious training, or his
political view.
Since the days of Abraham many men of
unusual intellect not only have diligently studied
the divine plan, but have devoted their lives to
having a part in making it known to others.
There were twenty-four holy prophets, whosemessages are recorded in the Bible. All of these
foretold a coming time of great blessings to the
human race. Their utterances were not their
own, but they spake as the spirit of Jehovahmoved upon them. It was impossible for ahuman mind to look down through the corridors
of the ages and to foretell what the future wouldbring forth ; but these various prophets, guided
by the all-wise Creator who knew the end fromthe beginning, wrote and spake merely as the
instruments of God. God never failed in one
of his promises. He says, "For I am the Lord,
1 change not". (Malachi 3:6) "There hath not
Millions Nova Living Will Never Die 9
failed one word of all his good promise." (1! Kings 8:56) All students of the Bible agree
that the time must come when every promise of
Jehovah will be fulfilled. Jehovah does everything orderly and on time and exactly in his own, *ydue time, and not man's due time. One day with { -7him is as a thousand years and a thousand years I as one day ; and what might seem to man a long
deferred fulfillment of a promise would be to
God only a question of a very brief space of time.
All students of the Bible also agree that it has
pleased Jehovah to divide the social order of
things existing from the beginning of the world
into epochs, which epochs we call worlds, and
which the Lord speaks of as worlds—such a use
of the word "world" meaning a social order of
things existing within a given period of time.
For nearly nineteen centuries students of divine
prophecy have expected and looked for the world
to end, because Jesus taught it would end. ManyChristian men, however, failing to recognize
the distinction between the symbolic and literal
phrases of the Bible, have been confused concerning the end of the world. For instance, the
great John Calvin taught that upon the happening of that event Jesus, reappearing near the
earth, would cause fire to be emitted from the
clouds, setting the earth aflame and totally
destroying it and everything on it. He being a
clergyman of great renown was supposed to
have based his conclusions upon a proper
interpretation of the Bible, and great numbers
10 31illions Now Living Will Never Die
believed his teaching ; and for this reason, withfear and trepidation, many have looked forwardto the ending of the world.
Eeason would lead us to the conclusion that
Jehovah would not create a wonderful earthlike this, permit man to bring it to a high state
of cultivation in many places, and then completely destroy it. Such is wholly out of harmony with his character. Likewise such is
wholly out of harmony with the plain teachings
of his Word, which says: "The earth abideth
forever". (Ecclesiastes 1:4) "For thus saith
the Lord that created the heavens ; God himselfthat formed the earth and made it; he hathestablished it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited." (Isaiah 45 : 18) When the
Bible speaks of the world ending at does notmean the literal earth, but it does refer to anepoch or dispensation of time during which acertain arrangement of things or social orderexists. In proof of this the Scriptures disclose
that there was a "world" which existed from the
time of Eden until the great deluge : "Wherebythe world that then was, being overflowed withwater, perished." (2 Peter 3:6) At the end of
the flood a new "world" began, and the promiseis made by the same Scriptural writer that it shall end. The period of that world is from the
flood until the coming of Messiah's kingdom,and his kingdom is to mark the beginning of
another new world or new order of things.
The first world, then, began with the creation
Millions Noiv Living Will Never Die 11 of man and ended with the flood. At the time of
the deluge began the second world, which the
Scriptures speak of as "the present evil world"
;
and God clearly foretold that the second world,
or social order of things, visible and invisible,
would pass away during a fiery time of trouble
;
and then would follow the world to come, the
social order or arrangement of things. St. Paul
instructs us to "rightly divide the word of truth"
;
and this means, amongst other things, to apply
the texts of Scriptures within the period or epochto which they belong; and applying these in
their proper place, one can discern the orderly
and majestic forward movement of the divine
arrangement.
All students of the Bible further agree that
just before Jesus was crucified he told his disciples that he was going away, but that he wouldreturn again and receive them unto himself, andthat his second coming would mark the end of
the world, i. e., the social order of things existing at the time he was on the earth. OtherScriptures show that at that time the great
blessing long promised, viz., life, liberty andhappiness, would be offered to the entire humanfamily.
All students of divine prophecy agree that the
promises of God made through the prophets
must have a fulfillment some time, and that the
time for fulfillment relating to the restoration
of the human race to life, liberty and happiness
has its beginning at the end of this world and at
12 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
the beginning of the new world, i. e., at the time
when the social order of things existing in
Jesus' day shall pass away and the new order be
established. By faith the prophets of old looked
for that time and hailed its coming as the
Golden Age, becanse dnring that age the Messiah shall reign and establish righteousness in
the earth.
It must be conceded, then, by all that the first important question for our determination is,
[When does this world end? If we can definitely
fix this period, then it is an easy matter to determine when the divine promises with reference to
life everlasting will be opened to the world in
general. We therefore propose to prove in this
argument that the social order of things, the
second world, legally ended in 1914, and since
that time has been and is passing away ; that the
new order of things is coming in to take its place ; that within a definite period of time the
old order will be completely eradicated and the
new order in full sway; and that these things
shall take place within the time of the present
generation and that therefore there are millions
of people now living on earth who will see themtake place, to whom everlasting life will beoffered and who, if they accept it upon the termsoffered and obey those terms, will never die. If
these facts can be established by competent tes- timony to the satisfaction of the reasonable
mind, then every man should hail it with gladness, every one should be delighted, even though
Millions Now Living Will Never Die IS
it upsets his preconceived opinions, formed fromthe study of the creeds and plans of men. Weinvite the reader, therefore, to examine eachpoint carefully as here made, compare the argument with the Scriptures cited, and view the same in the light of present day events whichare discernible to all eyes, and upon all this evidence reach a conclusion. Every man should bepersuaded in his own mind and no man shouldpermit himself to be deterred from examining aquestion based upon the Bible because a clergyman or any one else makes the unsupported as- sertion that it is dangerous or unworthy of consideration. Error always seeks the dark, whiletruth is always enhanced by the light. Errornever desires to be investigated. Light alwayscourts a thorough and complete investigation.
Light and truth are synonymous. They areprogressive, and "the path of the just is as theshining light, that shineth more and more untothe perfect day". (Proverbs 4 : 18) The Psalmist plainly tells us : "Thy word is a lamp untomy feet, and a light unto my path".—Psalm119:105.
GENTILE TIMES
The term Gentile times as used in the Scriptures designates a period of time during whichthe Gentiles were to govern the peoples of earth.
At the death of Jacob God organized Israel into a nation and dealt with that nation, to the exclusion of all other nations of earth, for a specific
time. Time and again they departed from their
14 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
covenant with Jehovah and he punished them.Time and again he warned them against a punishment of greater duration unless they profited
by previous experiences. They had many kings—some good, some wicked. Zedekiah was the
last king, and he became so very wicked that
God issued this decree against him, saying:"Therefore thus saith the Lord God ; Because yehave made your iniquity to be remembered, in
that your transgressions are discovered, so thatin all your doings your sins do appear ; because,I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall
be taken with the hand. And thou, profanewicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, wheniniquity shall have an end, thus saith the LordGod; Eemove the diadem, and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that
is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it ; and it shall be nomore, until he come whose right it is ; and I will
give it him."—Ezekiei 21:24-27.
It is a well-known historical fact that Zedekiah at the time here mentioned was takenprisoner by King Nebuchadnezzar and carriedaway to Babylon. Afterward the Israelites werepermitted to maintain a national existence byother nations exercising a supervisory control over them, and this condition continued until
the year A. D. 73. What happened at the timeof the dethronement of Zedekiah was that the
crown, or dominion, or ruling authority overthe peoples of earth, was taken away from the
Millions Xow Living Will Never Die 15
Jews and permitted to be assumed by the Gentiles. The first universal empire was that of
Babylon, followed by Medo-Persia, then by
Greece, and later by Kome; and out of the
Koman empire have grown all the Gentile
nations of Christendom. As to how long this
punishment should be inflicted upon the Jews,
and therefore how long God would permit the
Gentiles to have the dominion, is fixed by the
Scriptures as seven symbolic times. (See Leviticus 26 : 18) A time in the Scriptures is used to represent a symbolic year. According to the
Jewish method of calculation a year is 360 days.
A day for a year, then, would make each time
360 years in duration. The seven times would
be a period of 2520 years, during which the
Gentiles should have the lease of power, and at
the end of which their lease of power would
legally cease to exist.
The date of Zedekiah's overthrow and the
establishment of Nebuchadnezzar's Gentile dominion, which was the first Gentile world government, is definitely fixed both by secular
history and the Scriptures as B. C. 606. In the
year A. D. 1, 606 years of the whole period had
expired. Adding 1914 years to the 606 would
make a total of 2520 years, therefore bringing
the period of the Gentiles7 lease of power or dominion to an end in the year 1914. This date
corresponds with the circumstantial evidence
proving conclusively when the world would
begin to end, i. e., when the old order would
16 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
begin to pass away, and fixes the time for the
manifestation of Messianic power and the bringing in of the new order of things.
By way of illustration, if a man purchases apiece of property on which is situated a decayedbuilding and upon which lot he expects shortly
to erect a new structure, the first work in whichthe new owner engages is to clear the lot of the
decayed building, preparatory to erecting the new. By analogy, then, if the old order began to pass away in 1914 and Messiah began to exercise
his power, preparatory to setting up the kingdom of righteousness, then we should expectthat his first work would be the destruction of
the old systems of unrighteousness.
We here introduce the testimony of a witnesswhose competency cannot be questioned andwhose testimony must be accepted as absolutely
true. This witness is Jesus of Nazareth. Toorthodox Jews he was a great teacher amongstthe Jews. To Christians he was not only agreat teacher, but by them is accepted and rec- ognized as the Son of God, the Kedeemer of
mankind, the Savior of the world, the King of
glory. He testified that the Jews should betrodden down of the Gentiles until the times of
the Gentiles be fulfilled. (Luke 21: 24) He gaveto John the Eeveiator instruction as to whatwould take place when that time should arrive
and when he, the Messiah, should begin to exercise his kingly power. He pictures the prophets,
the mouthpieces of Jehovah, as saying con-
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 17 cerning himself, the Messiah : "We give thanks,
Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, andart to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy
great power, and hast reigned [exercised regal
authority]. And the nations were angry, andthy wrath is come."—Revelation 11 : 17, 18.
Here, then, we definitely see that the Gentile
times ended in the fall of 1914. At that time,
true to the prophetic statement, the nations did
become angry and God's wrath has been uponthe nations since. Every nation under the sunhas been growing weaker.
END OF THE WOULD
Fully corroborative of this testimony, wedirect attention to the further testimony of
Jesus set forth in the 24th chapter of Matthewonly a few days before his crucifixion, to wit, in
the spring of A. D. 33: "As he sat upon the
mount of Olives, the disciples came unto himprivately, saying, Tell us, when shall these
things be? and what shall be the sign of thy
presence, and of the end of the worldf After
giving them warning not to be deceived by other
testimony, the Lord plainly answers their question : "Nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be
famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in
divers places. All these are the beginning of
sorrows." (Matthew 24: 7, 8) In other words,
he stated that a great world war would ensue,
in which the nations and kingdoms of the earth
18 Millions Noic Living Will Never Die
should be involved. That great war began ex- actly on time, at the end of the Gentile times;
and there the old order began to pass away.The war, involving nearly all the nations of
earth, continued for about four years, and its destructiveness of treasure and human life is unparalleled in any other time of man's history.
It will be noticed that Jesus said this wouldbe accompanied by famine. Since the comingof the war there has been great distress in the
world because of the shortage of food. In manyof the countries of Europe thousands have lit- erally starved to death. The food shortage in
every country on earth is very apparent and the
cost of living mounts higher and higher. Thisis not due to the fact that the earth is less productive, nor is it due to the fact of man'sinability to plant and produce more; but it is due to the unsettled conditions resulting fromthe world war, which conditions Jesus clearly
foretold would accompany the war; and it is another evidence that 1914 marked the beginning of the end of the world ; for Jesus plainly
said, "These are the beginning of sorrows".
Furthermore, it is observed, Jesus said that
the war and famine would be accompanied bya pestilence. This has been literally fulfilled. The Spanish influenza swept over the earth andin less than twelve months the victims from that
dread pestilential disease outnumbered two to one of those who died during the great world
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 19 war in four years; and now this is being fol- lowed in the European countries by the direful
pestilence of typhus, against which the people
are being warned.
Again Jesus said that the war, famine and
pestilence would be followed by earthquakes.
It was not unusual for Jesus to use symbolic
language; in fact, he often used symbolic language or dark sayings to conceal the real meaning until the due time should come. In Biblical
symbology earthquake means revolution. Following the war have come famine, pestilence and
revolutions in many countries—some bloody
and some bloodless. Russia has experienced her
revolution and there the Babylonish systems
have fallen. The same thing has occurred in
Germany, in Austria and Hungary; and the
spirit of revolution is rife everywhere. This
does not mean the end of the trouble, but it does
mean, according to Jesus' words, that the old
world legally ended in 1914 and the process of
removing the worn out systems is now progressing, preparatory to the inauguration of Messiah's kingdom.
CORROBORATIVE TESTIMONY
It will be interesting here to examine a picture
that Jehovah caused to be made centuries ago.
The prophet Elijah was used as a type of the
true followers of Christ Jesus. His journey to
Mount Horeb pictures the journey of the true
Christians down to the time of the end of the
20 Millions Now Living Will Never Die,
world. The Lord directed him to go forth andstand on the mountain, picturing the church insuch a position as to obtain a clear vision of theevents about to transpire and transpiring. ToElijah the Lord said : "Go forth, and stand uponthe mount before the Lord. And, behold, theLord passed by, and a great and strong windrent the mountains [symbolically representingkingdoms] , and brake in pieces the rocks [strongparts thereof] before the Lord; but the Lordwas not in the wind [symbolic of war] : andafter the wind an earthquake [symbolic of revolution] ; but the Lord was not in the earthquake : and after the earthquake a fire [symbolicof greater troubles] ; but the Lord was not in thefire: and after the fire a still small voice/'
1 Kings 19:11,12.
In 1898 Pastor Eussell, the greatest Biblestudent of modern times, commenting on theabove Scripture, said:
"The four exhibitions of the Lord, given to Elijah,
represent, Ave believe, four manifestations in which theLord is about to reveal himself to mankind, the first three of which will prepare men for the final one, in which will come the desired blessing to all the families
of the earth. These are: "(1) The mighty winds rending the very rocks. Blowing winds seem to be used in Scripture for wars. The wars, whose dark clouds have threatened the civil- ized world so ominously for the past thirty years, havebeen miraculously hindered to give opportunity for 'seal- ing' the Lord's consecrated people in their foreheads
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 21
(intellectually) with the present truth. We are there- fore to expect that when these winds of war shall be
let loose, it will mean a cataclysm of warfare which shall divide kingdoms (mountains) —prefigured by the
mighty wind shown to Elijah (1 Kings 19: 11), which
rent the rocks. But God's Kingdom will not follow the
epoch of war ; the world will not thus be made ready for the reign of Immanuel. No; a further lesson will be
needed and will be given. It is represented in "(2) An earthquake. Throughout the Scriptures an
earthquake seems always to represent revolution; and
it is not unreasonable to expect that an era of general
warfare would so arouse the lower classes of Europe and
so discontent them with their lot (and especially with
the conditions which would follow such a war) that
revolution would be the next thing in order. (Eevelation
16: 18) But, severe though those revolutionary experi- ences will be to the world, they are not sufficient to pre- pare men to hear the voice of God. It will require
"(3) The fire from heaven—an epoch of divine judgments and chastisements upon a maddened but unconverted world, wild in anarchy, as other Scriptures show
us. The results of their wars, revolutions and anarchy,
in the failure of their schemes, will have a humbling
effect, and will prepare mankind for God's revelation of himself in "(4) The still small voice. Yes; he who spoke to the
winds and the waves of the sea of Galilee will, in due
time, 'speak peace to the peoples'. He will speak with
authority, commanding the observance of his long
neglected law of love. 'And whosoever will not hear that prophet shall be cut of! from among the people/—Acts
3 : 23."—The Finished Mystery.
Every close observer will witness that tliis
22 Millions Noiv Living Will Never Die
prophecy has been partially fulfilled and is still in course of fulfillment.
ISRAEL'S DOUBLE
The Jewish people God used as a typical
people. Their law foreshadowed better things
to come in the future. (Hebrews 10:1) Keeping in mind that prophecy means history written
in advance, i. e., that the divine mind foreknewfrom the beginning the end and caused the sali- ent points to be recorded for the benefit of those
living at the times when they should happen, let us nowT examine further the testimony of Jesus on this point. He said : "Now learn a parable
of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender,
and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summeris nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the
doors". (Matthew 24: 32, 33) The fig tree here
is symbolic of the Jewish nation. We reach that
conclusion from what Jesus himself said in curs- ing the fig tree a few days before he gave utter- ance to the words above quoted.—Matthew 21
:
19, 20.
Jehovah, through Jeremiah his prophet, foretold to Israel that the climax of their punishment would come when he would drive them out
of the land of Palestine into a strange country,
where they would have to serve others and be
oppressed for the same length of time that he
had shown them his favor, the words of the
prophet here being : "Therefore will I cast you
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 23
out of this land into a land that ye know not,
neither ye nor your fathers ; and there shall ye
serve other gods day and night ; where I will not
show you favor. Therefore, behold, the dayscome, saith the Lord, that it shall no more be
said, The Lord liveth, that brought up the chil- dren of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but.
The Lord liveth, that brought up the children
of Israel from the land of the north, and fromall the lands whither he had driven them; andI will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers. Behold, I will send for
many fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish
them; and after will I send for many hunters,
and they shall hunt them from every mountain,and from every hill, and out of the holes of the
rocks. For mine eyes are upon all their ways:
they are not hid from my face, neither is their
iniquity hid from mine eyes. And first I will
recompense their iniquity and their sin double
;
because they have defiled my land, they havefilled mine inheritance with the carcases of their
detestable and abominable things."—Jeremiah16:13-18.
Here it is to be seen that God not only foretold
driving them out and punishing them, but that
he would ultimately bring them back into Palestine ; and the length of their punishment wouldbe an exact double—a counterpart or duplication—of the time during which he had bestowedhis favor upon them. "First I will recompensetheir iniquity and their sin double." The word
24 Millions Noio Living Will Never Die
double here means duplication or exact counterpart. , If we can get the proper location of these
time features, ascertain where the double began,
we can very easily determine when God's favor
should be due to return to the Jews and whatrelation that has to the budding of the fig tree, as above stated.
God is his own interpreter and will make plain
his plan to those who study to understand it. Through the mouth of another prophet he gives us the key to the location of the very day of
the beginning of this double. The prophetZechariah records concerning Jerusalem these
words: "Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion;
shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy
king cometh unto thee: he is just, and havingsalvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, andupon a colt the foal of an ass". "Turn you to
the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: eventoday do I declare that I will render double
unto thee." (Zechariah 9:9,12) This prophetic statement of the Lord must have a fulfill- ment at some time and it is quite evident that
its fulfillment would mark the date from whichthe double counts.
PROPHECY FULFILLED
On the 10th day of Nisan, A. D. 33, corre- sponding practically with our month of April,
Jesus of Nazareth rode into Jerusalem upon anass and offered himself as king to the Jews. St. Matthew records the incident in the following
Millions Noic Living Will Never Die 25
words: "And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the
mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,
saying unto them, Go into the village over
against you, and straightway ye shall find an
ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and
"bring them unto me. And if any man say ought
unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of
them ; and straightway he will send them. All
this was done that it might be fulfilled whichwas spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the
daughter of Zion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt
the foal of an ass. And the disciples went, anddid as Jesus commanded them, and brought the
ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes,
and they set him thereon. And a very great
multitude spread their garments in the way;others cut down branches from the trees, andstrawed them in the way. And the multitudes
that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David : Blessed is lie that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosannain the highest."—Matthew 21: 1 - 9. Here, then, is a positive statement of the fulfillment of Zechariah's prophecy, and the veryday of it is fixed ; and so the Lord said, "TodayI declare that I will render the double unto
thee". That very day, then, marked the middle
point in the history of the Jews. It is exceedingly important, then, to find out how long they
had been in God's favor. The death of Jacob,
26 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
when he called his twelve sons before him andblessed them, is the beginning of the nation of
Israel ; therefore the date of the beginning of the
favor upon Israel. From the death of Jacobuntil the 10th day of Nisan A. D. 33 was 1845
years. That is to say, on the 10th day of NisanA. D. 33 the double began to count, and fromthat day Palestine began to disintegrate, the
Jewish nation began to melt away ; and exactly
forty years from that date Palestine was completely depopulated. In other words, a periodof forty years was occupied by Jehovah fromthe time he began to execute the double until
Palestine was completely depopulated. As evidence of this, we cite the following historical
accounts
:
"It may be proper to mention also what things
occurred that show the benignity of that all- gracious Providence, that had deferred their
destruction for forty years after their crimes
against Christ/' (Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History) "On the 15th day of Nisan, i. e., of April,
in the year 73 A. D., the first day of the Easterfestival, the same day on which, according to
tradition, the God of Israel had led his peopleout of Egyptian bondage into freedom, the last
bulwark of Israel's liberty had fallen, and Israel
was delivered into bondage/' (Cornil's Historyof the People of Israel) "Masada attained greatimportance in the war with the Romans. • . . With the fall of Masada the war came to an end, on the 15th of Nisan, 73/' (The Jewish Encyclo-
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 27 pedia) "The capture of Masada, a Jewish fortress on the southwestern shores of the Dead
Sea, put a termination to one of the fiercest
struggles recorded in history (73 A. D.)." (Morrison's Jeivs Under Roman Rule) "Judea was
not entirely subjugated; for three strong fortresses were still in arms : Herodium, Machaerus, and Masada. . . . The heroes agreed to this
proposal (of their leader Eleasar) even with
enthusiasm, and on the first day of the great
Feast of the Passover (A. D. 73), after slaying
their own wives and children, they all perished on their own swords/' (Graetz's History of the
Jews, Vol. 2) "Eleasar accordingly persuaded
all his people during that night to kill their
wives and children and then themselves, but to burn all their treasures first. The next day the
Eomans found only 960 dead bodies, whilst but
two women and five children hid themselves in caverns and were discovered. The Easter of the
year 73, just seven years from the beginning of
the great movement and forty years after
Christ's crucifixion, saw this end "of the whole
tragedy." (Ewald's History of Israel, Vol. 7)
The historian Josephus corroborates these dates.
DOUBLE BEGINS TO END
The double began to count, as stated, in the
spring of the year A. D. 33 ; and since the period
of favor had been 1845 years, the period of punishment should likewise be 1845 years. Then
adding 1845 years to A. D. 33 brings us to 1878
;
28 Bullions Now Living Will Never Die
and on the latter date, if our calculations be correct, we should find, according to the parallel ordouble, that some time during the year 1878there should be some marked beginning of God'sfavor returning to the Jew. In other words,here should begin the budding of the symbolicfig tree, which ought to be specially marked fortyyears later, viz., in 1918, if this parallel is car- ried out. FAVOR BEGINS TO RETURN
In the summer of 1878, exactly on time andwhen we should look for God's favor to returnto the Jew, we find there transpired a certain
event of the greatest importance that had happened to Jewry in more than 1800 years. I quotefrom the Jewish Encyclopedia, which is a recognized authority: "Russia, at war with Turkey,was successful, and by the treaty of SanStephano practically effaced Turkey fromEurope. Lord Beaconsfield, a Jew, came into
power in 1874. As Premier of Great BritainBeaconsfield sent the English fleet into the Dardanelles and brought Indian troops to Maltaand made a demonstration against Russia. Sheyielded and agreed to a discussion of the wholeaffair at Berlin. Accordingly from June 13 to
July 13, 1878, the Berlin Congress was held.
Beaconsfield compelled Russia to greatly modifyher treaty. Turkey was enfranchised and madeindependent, but upon condition that civil andreligious rights be granted to the Jews. This
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 29
had an important bearing on the history of the
Jews."
Other authorities state that Beaconsfield presided at that Congress, wrote the treaty and
was the leading factor. As you well know, his
real name was D'Israeli, a thorough, full-blooded
Jew, the first and only Jewish prime minister
Great Britain has ever had. From that time on
the favor of the Lord began to be shown again
to the Jewish people. According to the parallel
we should expect God's favor to increase toward
the Jews from 1878, and should have some special climax in the year 1918.
ZIONISM
For many centuries there have been repeated
efforts to destroy the Jews, all of which have
failed. God never intended that they should be
destroyed and they never shall be destroyed.
Their persecutions have held them together as a people and increased their longing desire for a home in the land of their fathers. In dealing
with his people God always raises up a man at
the opportune moment and often the man who
proves his faithfulness to the task imposed upon
him dies a martyr to the cause. In times past
Jehovah has proven his purpose of making the
wrath of man to praise him, and every one who
has suffered for a righteous cause will in due
time receive a reward for his faithfulness to the
principles of truth and righteousness.
In 1860 there was born in Budapest a Jewish
30 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
child who grew to manhood's estate. Choosingfirst the law as a profession, he soon embracedjournalism and forged to the front amongst thejournalists and writers of the world. His heartwas torn and bleeding because of the wicked andunjust persecution of his kinsmen, the Jewishpeople, which led to the formation in his mindof a scheme for their relief. In 1896 he gaveexpression to this scheme in his splendid paper,A Jewish State) and there many Jews of theworld began to awaken to the fact that their cause had found a champion in this man. Whenfirst A Jewish State appeared, his office assistantwept, because he thought the author had lost hismind ; but as the import of this paper was considered, it was hailed as a message of deliver- ance by many of the oppressed Jews of theworld. He spent his life in the interest of thecause and his last words were : "Greet Palestinefor me ; I have given my life for my people."
Today the name Theodor Herzl is a householdword amongst the Jews of earth and the timewill come when the peoples of earth, Jew andGentile, wall recognize that Theodor Herzl wasraised up at the opportune moment to give birthto Zionism, which is destined to succeed beyondthe dreams of its originator.
CAUSE FOR ZIONISM
What was the inducing cause for the formation of Zionism? Was it due to the prosperityof the Jews f No, indeed. Let the beloved Herzl
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 31 answer: "The scheme in question [Zionism]
included the employment of an existent propelling force. Everything depends on our propelling force. And what is our propelling force?
The miseries of the Jews,"
If we find that God foreknew the condition of
misery of the Jews and permitted it to prepare
the Jews for the Zionistic movement in order
that they might be turned back to their homeland, will not that strengthen faith in the promises of Jehovah concerning what will be the
ultimate result % "And I will cause them to pass
over with thy enemies into a land which thou
knowest not ; for a fire is kindled in my anger, over you shall it burn." "Therefore will I hurl
you out of this land into the land of which ye
had no knowledge, neither ye nor your fathers
;
and there shall ye serve other gods by day and
by night ; so that I will not grant you any favor.
Behold, I will send for many fishermen, saith
the Lord, and they shall fish them; ana after
that will I send for many hunters, and they
shall hunt them from every mountain, and from
every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks."
"And thou shalt become an astonishment, a
proverb, and a by-word, among all the nations
whither the Lord will lead thee."—Jeremiah 15
:
14 ; 16 : 13, 16 ; 24 : 9 ; Deuteronomy 28 : 37.
DEVELOPMENT OF ZIONISM
Officially organized in 1897, Zionism has advanced year by year. The first congress held in
32 Millions Notv Living Will Never DieBasle, Switzerland, in that year was attendedby 206 delegates, only a handful of Jews;whereas today Zionism has its organization inevery part of the world where there are Jewsand there are some of them almost everywhere.Large sums of money have been raised andexpended in the establishment of many agricultural settlements. Scientific methods have beenemployed in agriculture. Schools have beenestablished, and the foundation of the greatHebrew University has been laid on the Mountof Olives. The organization of colonies is progressing. Jews are acquiring the land in Palestime and building houses ; waste lands are beingreclaimed and gradually the nation is rising.
DOUBLE FULFILLED
When Zionism was organized, among otherthings the first congress declared that its aimwas and is the procuring of such governmentsanctions as are necessary in the achievementof the objects of Zionism.
As above noted, the favor of God begantoreturn to the Jews in 1878 and according to theprophetic double foretold by the Lord's prophets, forty years later, or in 1918, there should besome marked and special manifestation of God'sfavor toward the Jew. The Jewish year beginsin the autumn ; therefore November, 1917, wouldbe in fact the beginning of 1918. In 1917 theAllied armies drove back the Turk and took possession of Palestine. On November 2, 1917, or
Millions Noio Living Will Never Die 33 about the second month of the Jewish year
1918, Great Britain officially recognized Zionism, as appears from the following
:
"Foreign Office, Nov. 2nd, 1917.
"Dear Lord Eothschild:
"I have much pleasure in conveying to yon on behalf
of His Majesty's Government, the following declaration
of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations, which has
been submitted to, and approved by, the Cabinet
:
" fHis Majesty's Government view with favor the
establishment in Palestine of a National Home for the
Jewish people, and will nse their best endeavors to facil- itate the achievement of this object, it being clearly
understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish
communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.' "I should be grateful if you would bring this declara- tion to the knowledge of the Zionist Federation.
"Yours sincerely,
"Arthur James Balfour."
Within the year 1918 ten nations of earth, including Great Britain and the United States,
gave official endorsement of the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. It was in the
spring of 1918, about the anniversary of the
deliverance of the children of Israel from Egypt,
exactly forty years from the time when the favor
began to return to the JewT
, that a commission in
charge of Dr. Chaim Y\7eizmann, with full authority from the British Government, sailed
from London to Palestine, clothed with authority
34 Millions Note Living Will Never Dielooking to the establishment of a Jewish com-monwealth in Palestine. Thus we see that thedouble was fulfilled exactly on time, as God hadforetold through the mouth of his prophets.
FURPOSE OF ZIONISM
The first Zionist congress, convened at the instance of the much beloved Theodor Herzl, madea clear declaration as to its purpose and thatprogram has never been altered. The purposeis thus stated:
"Zionism aims to create a publicly secured, legallyassured home for the Jewish people in Palestine. "In order to attain this object, the Congress adoptsthe following means:
" ( 1
) The promotion of the settlement in Palestine ofJewish agriculturists, handicraftsmen, industrialists,
and men following professions.
"(2) The federation and association of entire Jewryby means of local and general institutions in conformitywith the local laws. "(3) The strengthening of Jewish sentiment andnational consciousness. "(4) The procuring of such government sanctions asare necessary for achieving the objects of Zionism."
JEWS REBUILDING PALESTINE
The Jews are not only laying a foundation ofa state in Palestine, but they are putting inoperation great schemes for improving the country by means of rapid transit systems, systemsof irrigation, the building of houses, establishingof schools, and a great university at Jerusalem,
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 35
and many other things. We cite a few of these
events that have appeared in the public press
:
Special Bulletin No. 469, issued by the Zionist
Organization of New York City, states that the
average rainfall in Palestine is twenty-six inches,
and that this water stored up in Palestine would
be sufficient to support a population of 15,000,-
000 people. The present population is 600,000.
It further states that from the spring sixteen
miles south of Jerusalem great quantities of
water are flowing into the city. The public
press announces gigantic irrigation schemes
which, if carried out, will supply all Palestine
with an abundance of water for irrigation and
other purposes.
The Zionist Bulletin, under date of February
25, 1920, says:
"One million seven hundred thousand eucalyptus and
other kinds of forest trees are to be planted on an area
of 21,125 dunams.
"In Merchavia 20,000 eucalyptus trees are to be
planted, in connection with the sanitation of the settle- ment, on 200 dunams.
"In Kinereth and Daganiah 42,000 eucalyptus and
other kinds of forest trees are to be planted on 175
dunams on the slopes of the mountain, the farm of Kinereth, the banks of the Jordan and the shores of Lake Kinereth.
"In Bensehemen about 70,000 trees are to be planted on 230 dunams.
"In Hulda 425,000 trees are to be planted on 140
dunams.
"In Ber-Tobiah (Kastinie) 27,000 trees are to be
36 Millions Now Living Will Never Dieplanted on 380 dunams, apart from those alreadymentioned above. "In the surrounding of the colony of Chederah 50,000trees in all, mostly eucalyptus trees, are to be plantedon 1,000 dunams."
A special bulletin dated March 1, 1920, says
:
"Three thousand school children of Jerusalem, cele- brating the Jewish Arbor Day recently, planted 500trees in the suburbs of the Holy City, inaugurating theafforestation program of the Zionists to plant one million
trees this year in Palestine, according to a report fromthe Zionist Commission in Jerusalem.
"During 1919, 369,000 trees were planted in theeffort to restore Palestine's forests, wantonly destroyed
by Turkish misrule and by the war. The afforestation of Palestine, because of its importance in the agricul- tural rejuvenation of the country and in providing lumber for construction work of the future, is consideredone of the biggest reconstruction projects that the Zionists are attempting in the Holy Land."
Another special bulletin, under date of March26, 1920, says:
"For ten years this struggle was kept up, entirely byJewish labor. Today this once barren soil is coveredwith forests of olive and almond trees, 150,000 olive and 10,000 almond trees. Last year 100,000 pounds of almonds were sold, which together with the proceedsobtained from the sale of hides and wool from the extensive raising of cattle and sheep, produced a net profit of 15 per cent, on the original investment." It is of the keenest interest to all thoughtfulpersons to note that these activities of the Zionists were foretold by God's prophet more than2,500 years ago, who wrote: "I will open on
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 37
naked mountain-peaks rivers, and in the midst
of valleys fountains; I will change the wilder- ness into a pool of water, and the dry land into
springs of water. I will place in the wilderness
the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil- tree ; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine
and the box-tree together; in order that they
may see, and know and take (it to heart), and
comprehend together, that the hand of the Lord
hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath
created it."—Isaiah 41 : 18 - 20, Leeser.
"THEY SHALL BUILD HOUSES"
At the Zionist Executive Council held February 16, 1920, at London, Dr. Ruppin in the
debate proposed the founding of a large society
which should begin to build houses for workers
as rapidly as possible. And even now in parts
of Palestine houses are rapidly undergoing construction for the benefit of the constant flow of
Jewish population returning to the land. Again
we find that this is clearly in fulfillment of
prophecy written long ago for the purpose of
encouraging the Jews to have faith in the promises of the Lord. The houses now built are not
in the interest of profiteers, nor will the owners
be permitted to oppress those who live in them;
but the owners shall live in them as their own
homes, as the prophet of the Lord foretold:
"They shall build houses, and inhabit them ; and
they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of
them. They shall not build, and another in-
38 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
habit; they shall not plant, and another eat;
for as the days of a tree are the days of mypeople, and mine elect shall long enjoy the workof their hands. They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the
seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their off- spring with them/'—Isaiah 65 : 21 - 23.
Thus the testimony definitely establishes the
fact that God's favor has returned to the Jew;that the parallel is fulfilled ; that the fig tree is putting forth its leaves, according to the promise—all of which Jesus said would take place at theend of the world.
EVENTS OP NOAH'S DAY
Jesus did not leave us to make a decisionupon the happening of one event, but he enu-merated several things that would transpireduring the period when the world is ending. Hestated that as it was in Noah's day, so would it be at the end of the world. "As the days of
Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Sonof man be. For as in the days that were beforethe flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that
Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until
the flood came, and took them all away ; so shall
also the coming of the Son of man be."—Matthew 24: 37 -39.
The first world ended with the flood. Onehundred and twenty years before the flood Godinstructed Noah to prepare for it, that he might
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 39 save himself, and to preach to the people con- cerning the approaching end. In Noah's day the
people pursued their usual and customary
course of action and were wholly indifferent and
oblivious to the fact that the old order of things
was about to pass away in a great flood. So
likewise today the mass of humanity, pursuing
its usual way, is wholly oblivious to and entirely
ignorant of the great transition period we are now in. In Noah's day while he was preaching to the
people concerning the coming end of the world
many scoffed at him, jeered him and mocked
him, and thereby testified to their ignorance
concerning the events that were about to occur. Mark the parallel in events now transpiring.
Shortly after the capture of Palestine by the
Allied armies a number of good ministers of the
gospel met in London and issued the following
manifesto, as appears from a London press
report
:
"The following manifesto was recently issued by a number of England's most noted ministers: " 'First—That the present crisis points toward the
close of the times of the Gentiles. " 'Second-—That the revelation of the Lord may be
expected at any moment, when he will be manifested as evidently as to bis disciples on the evening of his resurrection. "Third—That the completed church will be translated, to be "forever with the Lord".
"'Fourth—That Israel will be restored to its own
40 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
land in unbelief, and be afterward converted by the
appearance of Christ on its behalf. " 'Fifth—That all human schemes of reconstruction
must be subsidiary to the second coming of our Lord,
because all nations will be subject to his rule. "'Sixth—That under the reign of Christ there will be a further great effusion of the Holy Spirit on all flesh. " 'Seventh—That the truths embodied in this state- ment are of the utmost practical value in determining
Christian character and action with reference to the
pressing problems of the hour/
"This remarkable statement was signed by A. C. Dixon and F. B. Meyer, Baptists; George Campbell
Morgan and Alfred Byrd, Congregationalists ; William
Fuller Gouch, Presbyterian; H. Webb Peploe, J. Stuart Holden, Episcopalians ; Dinsdale T. Young, Methodist.
"These' are well-known names, and are among the
world's greatest preachers. That these eminent men,
of different denominations, should feel called upon to issue such a statement is of itself exceedingly significant"
It is to be regretted that the ministers above
mentioned do not represent the sentiment of the
majority of clergymen in the world. To all people who think, it is apparent that there are two
classes of ministers in the world : the good andthe bad, the honest and the dishonest, the faithful
and the unfaithful. This same rule applies to almost any profession. But amongst all the
professions of the world, the man who occupies
the position of a minister of the gospel is honored above all others from the divine standpoint,
because he is supposed to deal with things pertaining to the Word of God. A faithful fulfill-
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 41 ment of his commission, then, puts him in the
honorable roll from God's viewpoint. On the
other hand, a man who assumes the title of a
minister of the gospel and who yields to the
flattery of the world and for this reason disregards the plain teachings of the Bible and leads
the people into error is himself a dishonor to the
ministry and a menace to the welfare of humanity. No honest minister will take issue with
me upon this point. Any one who insists that
this is not true at once puts himself in the cate- gory of the bad class. Let each one, then, apply
the measuring rod to himself and see which
class he is in. And if he sees he is in the wrongone, he will if he is honest get into the right
class as quickly as possible.
An enterprising newspaper man presented a copy of the foregoing manifesto to all the leading clergymen of one of the metropolitan cities
of America; and their action is an illustration
of how the majority have regarded the matter.
Invariably they scoffed at the thoughts therein
expressed; and many of them answered, "It is nonsense to talk about the world coming to an
end. That event will not happen for 50,000
years or more. This war is like any other warand these troubles upon earth signify nothing."
For more than forty years Pastor Eussell, a
faithful, consecrated Christian, proclaimed to
the people by word of mouth, through the public press and through his books, that 1914 wouldmark the end of the Gentile times; that the
42 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
world would begin to end at that time, and that
Messiah's kingdom would shortly follow. Afewministers here and there joined with him in the
proclamation, but the majority of them scoffed
at him and said all manner of evil against himbecause of his faithful proclamation of the message. The inspired witness of the Lord corro- borated his statement that there would be scoti- ers at this time who would oppose the testimonydivinely provided, saying : "There shall come in
the last days scoffers, walking after their ownlusts [selfish desires], and saying, Where is the
promise [proof] of his coming? for since the
fathers fell asleep, all things continue as theywere from the beginning of creation. For this
they willingly are ignorant of, that by the wordof God . . . the heavens [invisible ruling powers] and the earth [social order of things], whichare now, . . . are kept in store, reserved untofire [destructive trouble] against the day of
judgment and perdition of ungodly men/'—2
Peter 3:3-7.
The clear fulfillment of the above propheticstatement ought to be sufficient to convince anyreasonable and thoughtful mind that we are nowpassing through the transition period from the
old to the new order of things.
Concerning this same subject, the great Master further said: "The sun [shall] be darkened,and the moon shall not give her light, and the
stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of
the heavens shall be shaken". (Matthew 24: 29)
Millions Now Living Witt Never Die 43
These dark sayings or symbolic words of Jesus,as shown in the light of other Scriptures, meanthis: The sun represents the gospel of JesusChrist and him crucified, the philosophy of the
great ransom sacrifice. The moon pictures orsymbolizes the Mosaic law covenant arrangement, which foreshadowed the development ofGod's plan in both the Gospel and Millennialages. And the stars symbolize exalted ones,
teachers of the divine Word.
In fulfillment of this prophecy of the Lordeverybody has witnessed during the past decadea great falling away of clergymen from theplain gospel of Christ Jesus and him crucified.
In Xovember, 1917, there assembled in CarnegieHall, Xew York, ministers of the Jewish, Protestant and Catholic faiths, to discuss a commonbasis for action. In all that meeting the name ofJesus as the great Eedeemer was not mentioned.There was a decided tendency to unite uponquestions relating to civil or political affairs,
but the great doctrines of the truth taught bythe apostles and prophets became darkened andwere ignored. One speaker at that conventionsaid : "Here are three steps which we may take
:
( 1) the preparation of a book of selections fromthe Bible by an interdenominational commi ssion
appointed by the legislature or by the Board ofEegents for use in the schools ; (2) the formulation of a plan for non-proselyting cooperationbetween the schools and the various denominations, to the end that every child may have its
44 Millions Notv Living Will Never Die
democratical and its religious instruction; (3)
the granting of Eegents' credits for serious
work and Bible study outside of the schools."
This plan was enthusiastically adopted.
Another speaker, Dr. Finley, at that convention
said, as appeared in the public press : "The time
is come for Protestants, Catholics, Jew and Gentile, to cooperate to the end that every child
may have an intimation at least of his moral and
religious inheritance".
As further evidence, the Interchurch WorldMovement has united in action but absolutely
ignored the doctrines of the truth. Their state- ment, which appeared in a bulletin issued in
January, 1920, says: "We believe the time is fully ripe for such unity of action on the part
of united Protestantism that, without attempting to solve the problems arising from divergent
and conscientiously held points of view on matters of doctrine and policy, the churches are ready for a common program of activity".
In other words, they are ignoring the great
fundamental truths of Christianity foreshadowed by the typical sacrifices and made certain
by the one great sacrifice of Jesus, the selection
of the church and through the church the restoration of the world during the reign of Christ—clearly in fulfillment of the Master's words.
The stars, here representing the teachers of
spiritual things, are pictured as falling; therefore representing that men who have claimed to
teach the divine Word have fallen to the com-
Millions Noiv Living Will Never J3le 45
mon level of ordinary world politics. As to the
character of the Interchurch World Movementand showing that the purpose is not in harmonywith the divine plan and that it is ignoring the
plain purpose of Jesus and the apostles, wequote language recently uttered by some of the
leading figures in it. Dr. J. Campbell White,
Associate Greneral Secretary of the Movement,
according to the public press recently said : "To
carry out the new program of the cooperative
churches it will require 100,000 new employed
leaders during the next five years. They mustbe college graduates. An outlay of from $250,-
000,000 to $300,000,000 will be required to finance
this program during 1920, and it is proposed to raise it during the week of April 25 to May 2
;
one-third of the money to be devoted to education, another third to Americanization and a
third to reaching the billion persons in the nonChristian world. The world will be ruled bythe forces of Christianity in twenty years."
This Interchurch World Movement is what its name really implies, to wit, the world movingthe churches, or the churches moving in the wayof the world. The movement is really organized
in the interest of big business and political
forces. As evidence of this we cite the following
from the Interchurch Bulletin of recent date
:
"George W. Wickersham, formerly United States at- torney general, says in an interview that there is nothing
incompatible between Christianity and modern business
methods. A leading lay official of the Episcopal Church
46 Millions Note Living Will Never Die
declares that what the churches need more than anything
else is a strong injection of business methods into their management.
"To the missionary China owes her expertness in printing, as well as cotton and fruit agriculture.
"Siam has become proficient in tanning leather through the scientific aid of missionaries. "Brazil and India have increased the food production
of their soils through the guidance of men of the missions. "Japan is richer through the introduction of American fruit trees by the advance agents of Christianity and
progress. "Natives of South Africa, formerly unemployed, now
earn wages in sugar plantations and in the cultivation of cocoa beans, introduced by missionaries."
The Reverend David Carnegie in the Toronto
Globe says
:
"The Church, on this side of the Atlantic, at any rate, has taken sides with the employing and governing classes because of self-interest. She has been disloyal and
faithless to the charge committed to her, but, in spite of all, she remains the one great avenue through which
all that Christianity, stands for is expressed. She alone has the . spiritual message for the regeneration of in- dustry.
"How can the Church discover and use the secret of her power ? She has to discover that society and industry are inseparably linked together, that underlying
both are fundamental principles of which she is the
exponent."
Why do men who claim to be ministers of the
divine Word so dishonor the profession and
link hands with big business and politics? The
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 47 real reason is that they have lost their faith
in God and in his Word, the Bible. They are seeking prestige and power from human sources and not divine approval. As evidence of this
we quote from the Chicago Herald and Examiner of recent date:
"Methodist ministers were told yesterday that the
theological schools of America are drifting away from
the teachings of Christ, and that the Bible is no longer
regarded by many preachers as the standard of faith. "Dr. Henry Paul Sloan of the New Jersey annual
conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church spoke at the ministers' meeting held at First Church, Clark and
Washington streets, on the course of study required by
the church for every minister. He said twenty-five an- nual conferences had sent a petition to the coming general conference to be held at Des Moines next May,
demanding the course be revised. " 'Many Methodist ministers disbelieve some of the
fundamental conceptions of Christianity and teach the
higher criticism, which is destructive of the foundations
of evangelical belief/ said the speaker."
Occasionally we find a minister of the gospel
who has the courage to tell some of his brethren
of the ministry the truth concerning the present
condition. We quote the Reverend William
Allan, as reported by the New York American:
" 'One reason why there is so much cause for complaint about poor attendance at most churches is because
the Lord is not among us. In too many cases Christ is on the outside seeking to get in, while we are proud of the large sums of money we are able to raise by our
48 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
great mass movements, acting all the time as if silver and gold could take the place of spiritual power and
the grace of God, both of which only come when the
Lord is among ns. When he is among us "it will be
noised abroad that he is in the house" and the world will once more flock to the place where Jesus is. " f Oh, for a return of the old days, with the Lord in the midst of the assembly of his people, directing and
dominating the manifold activities of the church P "
It is gratifying to see now and then someChristian paper courageously telling the truth.
In an article concerning the Interchurch WorldMovement, the Christian Leader of Cincinnati
editorially says
:
"Any effort to secure apparent unity in sentiment and
organization apart from the doctrine of Christ is wholly
unworthy of the indorsement of any one who professes to acknowledge the sovereignty of our Lord and Savior. Neither the unity for which he so fervently prayed, nor
the organization which meets his approval, nor the spirit of his life, can be obtained by rejecting the doctrine of
Christ. The spirit and life of the Christ can not be manifest in the individual or in the organization of individ- uals unless there first be the doctrine of Christ. All talk therefore about accomplishing a union in spirit and or- ganization without appealing to all to obey the gospel of
Christ, is a cheat, a fraud, a deception, a device of Satan
to deceive the unwary. It is a conglomerate farcical inion for the purpose, chiefly, to bring the church of Christ into a compromising position and thus break the
force of the distinctive gospel which she preaches, or to make her so odious in the sight of all denominationalists
for not uniting in the Movement that all will shun her."

From the Los Angeles Times we quote
:
"In short, religion has decided to adopt the methods
of big business and brilliant financial cooperation, whatever its other multitudinous differences may be. OurChristian pastors and masters tell us, vide the advertisements, that 'business associations, governments andthe leaders of the great religious bodies have surveyed
world conditions, and their verdicts all agree* that nothing but millions can buy salvation for a 'world torn with
war'. And they are probably right, since that same
world which, we are told 'a great shaft of light has
struck*, boasts few humble carpenters and fishermen to renounce all worldly comforts—disciples to follow a possessionless Master today.
"Those expensive advertisements teem with ironical truths. 'The least pretentious business concerns nowtrain their sales forces : can the churches do less ?' they
demand. 'In America we must have Sunday School experts, Bible teachers, skilled fishers of men/ How very
far we have traveled from the simplicity of Jesus, fromthe Sermon on the Mount, from that sublime doctrine, free and gratis for all who cared to take. 'The realiza- tion of humanity's need for Christ at this time has fol- lowed with sudden, blinding brilliance, not unlike that which came to Saul of Tarsus/ we are told. But Sauls
of Tarsus seem to be peculiarly rare. Eather are they
forsaking the ministry on all sides because of the meager
worldly reward entailed. Nothing but millions can lure them back, or create new Sauls. Our modern Sauls don't
Millions Noio Living Will Never Die 53
accrue without expert training and the promised re- ward of high salaries. "Every item in those expensive advertisements is quite logical. One cannot take issue with a single
assertion. They all reek of efficient promise, of indubitable statements as to conditions and needed reforms.
And yet, somehow, they leave us with a feeling of irony
that Christianity should have come to such a pass. Per- haps it is the glaring omission of exhortation to our
spiritual duty—only our financial duty is emphasized.
We are not asked to each and every one of us constitute ourselves a personal missionary without pay. We are not asked to examine the condition of our own souls, our own lives, our own spiritual practices; we are only
exhorted to pay for the religious education of others, the
religious improvement of others. There are numerous
paragraphs beginning, 'Your money will/ etc., explaining just how much other people's service it will buy.
There are paragraphs referring to our
fduty?
, but they
all appertain to providing the money for other people's
duties. In fact, there is a general impression of buying
ourselves off from personal duties other than money and,
as the advertisements themselves declare, 'It were folly to think that money alone could carry Christianity for- ward; the main problem has always been leaders/ *We
must continue to send out men and women who will carry the Christ-life into their businesses, their recreations, and their homes/ Send other people out—you
seem not necessarily to be those people yourselves. 'Unless you falter, a generation of trained Christian leaders
will make your children bless your name/ is another
form of exhortation—our faltering strictly taking the
form of failing with the shekels. "They will raise their hundred millions, • . . but
54 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
unless most of us take our Christianity more personally
and individually, unless we recognize a few other re- quirements in ourselves besides furnishing the money,our deputed Christianity isn't going to do the worldmuch good, and our financial credit won't cut much ice in heaven/'
WALL STREET WITH A PIOUS PACE
Roger W. Babson, statistician-in-chief ofWall Street, in a letter dated January 27, 1920,and given limited circulation, says concerningthe churches:
"The value of our investments depends not on thestrength of our banks, but rather upon the strength of our churches. The underpaid preachers of the nationare the men upon whom we really are depending rather than the well-paid lawyers, bankers and brokers. Thereligion of the community is really the bulwark of ourinvestments. And when we consider that only 15% of the people hold securities of any kind and less than 3%hold enough to pay an income tax, the importance of the
churches becomes even more evident. "Eor our own sakes, for our children's sakes, for thenation's sake, let us business men get behind thechurches and their preachers ! Never mind if they are not perfect, never mind if their theology is out of date. This only means that were they efficient they would dovery much more. The safety of all we have is due to the churches, even in their present inefficient and inactive
state. By all thdt we hold dear, let us from this veryday give more time, money and thought to the churchesof our city, for upon these the value of all we ownultimately depends!"

Again the money-changers are operating in
the house of the Lord, and again seem appropriate the words of the Master : "It is written, MyA MOKE HONORABLE WAY
house is the house of prayer ; but ye have made
it a den of thieves/'—Luke 19 : 45, 46.
Of course "big business*' will raise the re- quired money because it thinks this necessary.
56 Millions Now Living Will Never DieDo the people wish to trust their spiritual interests with a class of men whose god is gold?
Occasionally yet very rarely you will findsome denominational minister who sees the subtlety of this movement and who has the courageto speak out. Dr. A. T. Peterson, an IllinoisBaptist preacher, says: "It is a super-leagueof nations".
Dr. Conant, an evangelist, in a published dis-course involving the Interchurch World Movement, says:
"Mergers are the order of the day in every line ofhuman activity, and the latest and most menacing is theInterehurch World Movement. By this movement thewhole Christian Church is being unconsciously mergedinto a great union church which will be headed byliberals [infidels, higher critics, evolutionists, opposersof the interests of both Gpd and man].
"This movement is shot through and through withfundamental error. Our Lord tells us that the missionof the church is to preach the gospel to every creature —just that and nothing more. But the leaders in this movement tell us that the mission of the church is to
'establish a civilization, Christian in spirit and in passion, throughout the world\ Those two conceptions will not mix any more than oil and water will. "And by their social service program they are seeking
to capture the functions of the state, and are thus uniting church and state." GOSPEL AS A WITNESS
Jesus further stated as an evidence of the endof the world : "This gospel of the kingdom shallbe preached in all the world for a witness unto
Millions Note Living Will Never Die 57
all nations; and then shall the end come".
Matthew 24: 14
If the leaders of the Interchurch WorldMovement claim that their purpose is the con- version of the world to Christianity, then we say
to them that they are too late. They are not
doing it the Lord's way. In the first place, they
are not preaching the gospel of the kingdom.
They frankly state they are ignoring the doctrinal truths of the gospel. In the second place,
the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom is not for the purpose of converting the whole
world, but for taking out from the world "a
people for his name". (Acts 15 : 14) Andthirdly, this has already been done and we are
at the end of the old order and the new is coming in. DISTRESS AND PERPLEXITY
The conditions which have arisen in the world
since 1914 are distressing and perplexing. All
the rulers of earth are perplexed. The financiers are in perplexity ; the business men are in
perplexity ; the people are in perplexity ; and all are in distress. Why is this so, and what does
it mean? Jesus further answered concerning
the end of the world, and in proof of it, that there
would be "upon the earth distress of nations,
with perplexity; the sea [restless humanity]
and the wraves [organized radical movements]
roaring ; men's hearts failing them for fear and
for looking after those things which are coming on the earth ; for the powers of heaven shall be
58 Millions Now Living Will Never Dieshaken". (Luke 21:25,26) This is daily incourse of fulfillment.
As a sample of how the rulers of earth viewthe matter, President Wilson, in his speech before Congress after the great war began, said
:
"These are days of great perplexity, whenagreat cloud hangs over the greater part of theworld. It seems as if great, blind, materialforces have been released which had for longbeen held in leash and restraint."
Fear has taken hold of men in all walks oflife. Selfishness seems to pervade every line ofbusiness. The landlord, feeling that he maynot get another such chance to reap a harvest,increases the rent upon his tenant. The groceryman, the dealer in other foodstuffs, clothing, etc., seem to fear that another opportunitywill not come and that now advantage must betaken of this opportunity to get all the moneypossible. The spirit of distrust exists everywhere. All of this is but in fulfillment of thewords of Jesus.
MAN'S DESIRE
Amidst all of this trouble, sorrow and distress, there is a longing desire in the heartsof the people ; and that desire is for life, liberty,and the pursuit of happiness. Almost everyone would prefer to dwell in peace with lovedones and to avoid strife and controversy; butconditions seem to be such that man's difficul- ties are insurmountable. They cannot do whatthey woxild like. Seemingly there is an unseen
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 59
force or power controlling tliem. And what is that power?
DEMONS ACTIVE
Again we refer to the fact that as it was in
Noah's day, so shall it be at the end of the world;
The Scriptures clearly teach that in Noah's daythe world had been overrun by fallen angels.
As set forth in the sixth chapter of G-enesis,
these had assumed the forms of men and, in
violation of their obligation to Jehovah, hadselected wives from amongst the human race, and there resulted an offspring which waswicked to the last degree, and the whole earth
was filled with violence. God brought on the
deluge. The Apostle Peter, answering as to what became of these demons, said: "Godspared not the angels that sinned, but cast themdown to lartarus, and delivered them into chains
of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment".
"Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the
just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit; by which also he went andpreached unto the spirits in prison : which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsnffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while
the ark was a preparing." (2 Peter 2 : 4 ; 1 Peter
3:18-20) "The angels which kept not their
first estate, but left their own habitation, he
hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day."
Jude 6.
60 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
These demons, restrained in the atmosphereabout the earth, have had power to communicate with the living ones of the human race through the instrumentality of mediums. Thesematters are fully discussed in my book, "TalkingWith the Dead", and I do not here go into detail.
I merely call attention to the fact that the clear
inference to be drawn from the above texts is that when the end of the world is reached thedemons would have greater power and wouldexercise that power over men. The Czar of
Eussia was constantly in communication withthe demons through a medium whom he keptin the royal palace. Emperor William of Germany claimed to have an "inner ear" and averredthat he heard "voices" from beyond and wasguided largely by these. The course of the demons is that of wickedness, and without a doubtthe great world war which started in 1914 waschiefly induced by the influence of these demons.The Scriptures tell us of a great whirlwindthat will be raised up from the coasts of the
earth. (See Jeremiah 23 : 19 ; 25 : 32, 33 ; 30 : 23,
24) A whirlwind is a symbol of a great war.The great war created an interest in spiritismsuch as the world has never known; and someof the leading minds of the world have becomedevotees of it and are proclaiming the spiritualistic doctrine to the confusion of mankind.These demons are otherwise described in the
Scriptures as the "four winds"; and Jesus,
speaking through the Eevelator, said: "I saw
Millions Noiv Living Will Never Die 61
four angels standing on the four comers of the
earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that
the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on
the sea, nor on any tree, . . . till we have sealed
the servants of our God". (Revelation 7:1-3)These winds, or powers of the air, are not powers of natural air, but are the powers referred
to by St. Paul when he speaks of "the prince of
the power of the air". (Ephesians 2:2) These
demons are exercising power over the minds of
the people, causing distress, discontent, rest- lessness, hatred, ill-will, malice, strife, and all kinds of controversy and trouble.
All of the elements, as the Lord foretold
through the Apostle Peter, are thus melting
away amidst fervent heat.—2 Peter 3 : 10.
EEMEDIES—HUMAN
What remedies do men offer to bring order
out of chaos and establish peace and prosperity
amongst the people f The financiers desperately
struggle to hold the present financial systems in
order; but they have no remedy and know of none to bring about a better condition.
After centuries of effort, political parties
have proved their inadequacy to meet the present conditions and to solve the distressing problems. Economists and statesmen, studying the
question diligently, find that they are able to do
nothing. And this applies to all political parties
and organizations, for the reason that all are composed of selfish, imperfect men; and therefore cannot bring about an ideal condition.
82 Millions Now Living Will Never DieLEAGUE OF NATIONS
With the cessation of hostilities, statesmenrepresenting the leading nations involved metin conference and (giving them credit for thedesire to establish peace and prosperity) theresult of their deliberations was a covenantknown as the League of Nations. This is offeredas a remedy for present evils. Will it succeed?A league formed amongst all the nations ofearth and based upon the principles of justiceand righteousness, and in which all the contracting parties would honestly carry out thepurpose expressed, would doubtless result ingreat good. But where selfishness is the chiefmotive and controls the action of any or all, anideal condition could not be attained. God in hiswisdom foreknew and foretold the formation ofthe League of Nations ; and he likewise foretoldthat it must fail.—Isaiah 8 : 9, 10.
The inducing cause for the formation of theLeague is admittedly fear. Faith in God andhis promises is entirely ignored. Because ofthese facts the League will never accomplish theexpressed desire. It is not God's way. He hasplainly said: "My thoughts are not yourthoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saiththe Lord. For as the heavens are higher thanthe earth, so are my ways higher than yourways, and my thoughts than your thoughts."(Isaiah 55 : 8, 9) Jehovah's great plan was entirely ignored in the formation of this Leagueof Nations. The prophet truly wrote : "Blessed
Millions Xoio Living Will Never Die 63
is the nation whose God is the Lord". (Psalm33:12) But a nation that ignores the divine
plan, or any league of nations formed whichignores the same, need not expect a desirable
result. The Lord's prophet clearly had in mindthe formation of the League of Nations, andalso the league of ecclesiastical systems, whenhe wrote: "Associate yourselves, ye people,
and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear,
all ye of far countries ; gird yourselves, and ye
shall be broken in pieces ; gird yourselves, andye shall be broken in pieces. Take counsel to- gether, and it shall come to nought: speak the
word, and it shall not stand."—Isaiah 8 : 9, 10.
ECCLESIASTICAL REMEDY
Ecclesiasticism relates to organized church
systems, and particularly to the clergymen or
priestly class operating and controlling the same. For a long time the Roman Catholic waspractically the only creed extant. In the sixteenth century there was a great reformation
movement and Protestant ecclesiasticism resulted. The ecclesiastics, therefore, come forwardwithaproposed remedy for distressed humanity
;
and since they do so, we are justified in a candid
examination of their proposed remedy to see whether or not it is adequate. The ecclesiastical
systems both Catholic and Protestant claim that
their mission is to convert the world, thereby
bringing the people into the churches. Let us suppose they could accomplish this expressed
purpose and that the whole human race was
64 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
brought into one or the other of the churches.
What, then, is the hope that they hold out to the
people ? The Catholic creed or teaching is that the
destiny of man is fixed at death and that those
who are good and faithful Catholics at death
pass on to heaven, a condition of endless bliss. All other Catholics who have not been faithful
in every particular go to purgatory, there to re- main for an indefinite period of time (not less
than a thousand years), during which time they
are supposed to be cleansed and purified andmade ready for the heavenly realm ; that all the
others, the heretics, the apostate, etc., mustspend their destiny in hell fire, consciously suffering forever.
The Protestant teaching generally is that the
destiny of every man is eternally fixed at death,
the faithful church member passing at death
into glory, a condition of bliss in heaven; andall others spending their eternity in conscious
torture, eternal in duration.
It will be noticed, therefore, that if there be
any real difference between these two remedies,
the Protestant remedy is the worse of the two,
because it offers no middle ground. It is plainly
to be seen by any one that neither the Catholic nor the Protestant creed offers any remedywhatsoever for the present disorder that wouldlead to peace, prosperity, liberty and happiness
and life everlasting on the earth. It follows,
then, that if they should succeed in converting
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 65 most or all of the people to their theories it would be no solution of the present problems.
The great difficulty with the systems ecclesiastical is that they ignore entirely the divine
remedy. They ignore the commission given to the Christian and build their hopes upon manmade theories, creeds and institutions. Theyignore completely the commission divinely given
to every one who has consecrated himself to do
the Lord's will. It will be admitted by both
Catholics and Protestants that only a small portion of the earth's population have even pretended to embrace the teachings of their respective systems, and the most sanguine amongst
them will never claim that they hope to convert
everybody to their way of thinking and bring
them into the church organization. The facts are that in modern times they have ignored the
doctrines and do not ask the people to believe
these but to unite in action; and the chief action
is the solicitation and collection of money. Seizing the war spirit, the spirit of the world, these
ecclesiastical systems now are engaged in raising millions of dollars, saying to the people:
"If only we had the money we could convert the
world". Is it not apparent to all that this is a
reflection on the Lord, that he needs money to carry out his purposes ; and is he pleased to use
the unconsecrated funds of the worldings to do
his work? Is it necessary to solicit in the nameof the Lord money from men who have no interest in the Lord's arrangement but who yield
66 Millions Now Living Will Never Dieto the importunities of the clergy and pay themoney in order that they may have a social orpolitical standing amongst a certain class ofpeople? Could it be said that the Lord mustresort to such methods in order to carry out hisarrangement ? Every reasonable man must say,Surely not. And again we are reminded of theLord's words through the prophet, directingthem at those who are advancing these worldlytheories : "My thoughts are not your thoughts,neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.For as the heavens are higher than the earth,so are my ways higher than your ways, and mythoughts than your thoughts."—Isaiah 55 : 8, 9. The wise man, then, is he who seeks to knowwhat is the divine remedy and, finding this,seeks to conform himself to it; for nothingelse short of divine power can bring order outof the present chaotic condition and bring toman that which he desires. Let us keep in mindthat it has ever been the desire of man to enjoylife, liberty and happiness. This was so uppermost in the minds of the forefathers in layingthe foundation for the American governmentthat they placed this statement in the fundamental law of the land. The people, therefore,are wasting their money, wasting their time andenergy to pursue a will-o'-the-wisp, a man-madetheory, in utter disregard of the divine remedy;
and, of course, if the people are ignorant of thisremedy which the Lord has provided, they can-not pursue it. The great masses are ignorant
Millions Noic Living Will Never Die 67 and their ignorance is due to the fact that the
ecclesiastics have been unfaithful to their commission, have failed to teach the Scriptures, but on the contrary have taught man-made theories
;
and for this reason God, foreknowing that it would be thus, recorded: "Behold, the days
come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a
thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the
Lord!'—Amos 8: 11.
After many centuries of divine favor the
clergy of the church nominal as a class has
proven unfaithful to the divinely given commission. After six thousand years of laborious
effort to establish an ideal government in the
earth, the nations are now face to face with a
condition of chaos, and mankind is groping
blindly about. The people who love righteous- ness and truth have been without aid, advice and
comfort from those from whom they might ex- pect it and who claim to be the messengers of
the Lord. These so-called spiritual advisers
have torn off the mask and now boldly declare
that they ignore the doctrines and unite in
action for money and power.
With the great doctrines of Christianity
ignored, upon what will the hungry souls feed? —those souls that hunger and thirst for righteousness, from whence will they gather their
satisfying portion? (Psalm 107 : 1 - 7) Is it not
time for all such to seek the divine remedy?
Man's extremity is God's opportunity. The
68 Millions Noiv Living Will Never Die
whole world is being humbled by suffering andsorrow. Let those who mourn be comforted bythe great and beneficent arrangement disclosedby his Word.
REMEDY—DIVINE
The Holy Scriptures contain the expression ofthe will of God concerning man. The Bible is theonly true source of knowledge upon which mancan base a hope for the future. The ApostlePaul with prophetic vision, looking on down to the time of the blessings that shall come to thehuman race, wrote to the followers of Jesus:"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither haveentered into the heart of man, the things whichGod hath prepared for them that love him. ButGod hath revealed them unto us by his spirit:
for the spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deepthings of God."—1 Corinthians 2 : 9, 10. It was the great Master who said : "Sanctifythem through thy truth: thy word is truth".(John 17:17) Nothing, then, but an understanding and appreciation of the Word of Godcan lead man into the right way and unfold to him visions of the blessings that are to come;and the understanding of the divine arrangement brings comfort and joy to the heart.
The inspired witness wrote: "Known untoGod are all his works from the beginning of theworld". (Acts 15 : 18) From the very creationof man to the full consummation of his planJehovah knew everything and his great programhas been working out in a progressive andI
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 69
orderly manner. In order, therefore, for us to appreciate the divine remedy we must first as- certain the real canse of the present condition
of strife, turmoil, trouble, wars, revolution, etc.,
in the earth.
THE CAUSE
The first man was created perfect and given a perfect home in Eden, endowed with life as a human being, with happiness, with peace, andwith all the blessings incident to a perfect life and a perfect home. He was endowed with the
power and authority to produce perfect children
and to fill the earth with a perfect race of people.
His enjoyment of those blessings eternally depended upon his obedience to the divine law;
and his disobedience of that law he was informed would lead to the forfeiture of his right
to life as a human being, as well as his right to happiness and peace. Man violated the law.
This account is briefly set forth in the third
chapter of Genesis. Man was sentenced to death, driven out from his perfect home, and the
judgment executed by causing him to subsist
upon the poisonous elements of the unfinished
earth. As long as he existed he was caused to eat his bread in sorrow. In all these centuries he
has been under the bondage of the evil effects
of sin, waiting and hoping for liberation.
It must be observed that Adam did not lose a home in heaven. He was not offered a home in
heaven; but what he did possess was a home on
earth, with human life in perfection, as a man;
TO Millions Now Living Will Never Die
and his violation of the lav/ forfeited these.
Therefore, if man is ever restored to his original
favors and blessing it must be to that which he
first enjoyed—perfection of life as a humanbeing, a perfect home, and peace and happinesson earth.
The disobedience of Adam entailed upon all of his offspring sorrow, sickness, suffering anddeath. The perfect pair did not bear children
while in Eden ; but they exercised this function
after the condemnation and after man wasearning his bread in the unfinished earth.
He was gradually undergoing the sentence of
death. He was imperfect, and it follows as alogical and reasonable conclusion that he could
not produce a perfect race of people. The result
was that his offspring were born in a dyingcondition. And this is what the prophet meantwhen he wrote: "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity ; and in sin did my mother conceive me".
(Psalm 51:5) This is the same thought ex- pressed by St. Paul when he wrote: "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world,
and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned".—Eomans 5 : 12.
REDEMPTION PROMISED
Jehovah had in mind from the beginningthe redemption of mankind from this condition
of suffering and death, and their restoration to that which was lost. Abraham, who lived in the
land of the Chaldees, trusted in Jehovah; and
Millions Noio Living Will Never Die 71 God called unto him and made Mm a promise,
saying: "I will bless thee, and make thy namegreat; and thou shalt be a blessing: . . . and in
thee shall all families of the earth be blessed".
(Genesis 12 : 2, 3) At the time this promise wasmade Abraham had no children. He was seventy-five years of age, his wife had passed the
age of child-bearing; yet he had faith in God,
and when Abraham was a hundred years old his son Isaac was born. When Isaac grew to manhood's estate God put Abraham to a test of
faithfulness to him and directed Abraham to
take his son Isaac into a mountain and offer himup as a sacrifice. It grieved Abraham's heart
much to do this; but having faith in God he
obeyed. Journeying to the mountain, he built an altar, bound Isaac to it, and the knife in his
hand was about to strike death to his son whenthe Lord called unto him out of heaven, saying
:
"Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do
thou any thing unto him : for now I know that
thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld
thy son, thine only son, from me". (Genesis
22 : 12) Thereupon God renewed his promise to Abraham and bound it with his oath, saying:
"By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for
because thou hast done this thing, and hast not
withheld thy son, thine only son : that in blessing
I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as
the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy
seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ; and
'72 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice".
—Genesis 22 : 16 - 18.
This promise to Abraham has not yet been
fulfilled. It must be fulfilled, because God is not
slack in any of his promises. He changes not. (Malachi 3:6) Clearly, the blessing here intended is life, liberty and happiness—a restoration to the very things Adam had forfeited byreason of his disobedience. All the prophets
who thereafter wrote foretold the coming of
such times of restoration and blessing.
The judgment of condemnation against Adamcould never be reversed because that would be
equivalent to God denying himself; therefore
the judgment must be enforced. But it would
be entirely consistent with the divine arrangement for provision to be made for satisfaction
of the judgment, thus maintaining the dignity
and majesty of the divine law. Hence God madepromise through the prophet Hosea, saying: "I
will ransom them from the power of the grave
;
I will redeem them from death : death, I will
be thy plagues ; grave, I will be thy destruction".—Hosea 13 : 14.
This provision for the satisfaction of justice
and release of mankind from condemnation
must come through the voluntary sacrifice of
another perfect human. The word ransommeans exact corresponding price. A perfect
man had sinned and forfeited life, liberty andhappiness. This penalty was demanded by the
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 73 divine law. Hence God could make provision
and did make provision that if another perfect
man could be found who would voluntarily permit his life, liberty and happiness to be taken
from him, all these rights could be substituted
for those which Adam had forfeited and thereby
lay the foundation or basis upon which Jehovahcould restore Adam and his offspring to liberty,
happiness and life. Of course, it follows that none of Adam's offspring could meet these
divine requirements, for the reason that all are
imperfect. Hence the Psalmist wrote : "None of
them can by any means redeem his brother, norgive to God a ransom for him". (Psalm 49: 7)
What, then, could be done for the redemptionof the human race?
THE RANSOMER
St. John records the fact that the Word or Logos was the beginning of Jehovah's creation,
and that he (the Logos) afterward becamethe active agent in the creation of everything made; and that "the Word [Logos] wasmade flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld
his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
Father, full of grace and truth". (John 1:14)
St. Matthew gives the account of the birth of
Jesus ; that he was begotten not by man but bythe power of Jehovah ; therefore he had none of
the inherited condemnation or contamination of
Adam. The Logos was transferred from the
spirit to the human plane. He became the child
74 Millions Now Living Will Never DieJesus. He was born "holy, harmless, undented,separate from sinners" (Hebrews 7 : 26) ; he waswithout sin. (1 Peter 1:19) He was bornunder the law covenant, which covenant fixed thelegal majority for priestly purposes at thirtyyears. Therefore when Jesus attained the yearsof maturity he was perfect physically, mentally,morally—perfect under the law, the exact counterpart of the perfect man Adam in Eden priorto his disobedience to the divine law. WhyhadJehovah permitted his beloved Son to be transferred from the spirit to the human plane 1 Whyhad he come to earth at all ? Let Jesus himselfanswer : "The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life aransom for many". (Matthew 20:28) Andagain he said : "1 am come that they might havelife, and that they might have it more abundantly". (John 10 : 10) Again, speaking in darksaying or symbolic phrase, he likens himselfunto bread, which men eat and live, saying : "Iam the living bread which came down fromheaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shalllive for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh [humanity], which I will give for thelife of the world".—John 6 : 51.
THE RANSOM PRICE
To ransom means to purchase, and the ransomprice means the exact corresponding price. Aperfect man had sinned and lost all. A perfectman now, by voluntarily going into death, would
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 75 provide the corresponding price for the redemption of mankind. Jesus was not a sinner. Henever committed a sin. Why, then, should hedie? St. Paul answers: "Christ died for oursins according to the Scriptures". (1 Corinthians 15 : 3) St. John adds : "He is the propitiation [satisfaction] for our sins : and not for oursonly, but also for the sins of the whole world".—1 John 2 : 2. "God so loved the world, that he gave his onlybegotten Son, that whosoever believeth in himshould not perish, but have everlasting life. ForGod sent not his Son into the world to condemnthe world ; but that the world through him mightbe saved." (John 3:16,17) Jesus was put to
death in the flesh, a man, and was raised fromthe dead a spirit being, divine in nature. (1
Peter 3: 18) He ascended on high as a divine
being, having the right to a perfect human life,
now to be given in the place of that which Adamhad forfeited; and by this perfect human life and all the rights incident thereto he had provided the ransom or purchase price for the re- demption and deliverance of all mankind fromdeath. As surely as God has made this provision, so surely then he will carry it into full force and effect. THE SEED
It will be noticed that in the promise Godmade to Abraham he said : "In thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed". (Genesis
28 : 14) The blessing here promised is life ever-
76 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
lasting. (Romans 6:23) It follows, then, that
before the blessing of life everlasting and the
blessings incident thereto could be extended to
mankind through the seed, the seed itself mustfirst be developed. The seed according to the
promise was the mystery for ages and generations. It is yet a mystery to all except those
who have given their hearts to the Lord and dil- igently sought to understand what constitutes
the seed. The Apostle Paul under inspiration
defined the seed : "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy
seed, which is Christ." (Galatians 3:16) Theword Christ here means anointed one. Theword Messiah means the same thing. The Christ
consists of Jesus glorified, the head) and the
members of his body, which constitutes the
church. "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, andheirs according to the promise." (Galatians
3:27, 29) "And he is the head of the body, the
church : who is the beginning, the firstborn fromthe dead ; that in all things he might have the
preeminence."—Colossians 1 : 18.
SELECTION OF BODY MEMBERS
Clergymen as a class, particularly of moderntimes, seem to misconceive entirely the commission of a Christian and the purpose that Godhas in developing that class. They ha^e con- ceived the thought and advance it to the people
Millions Now Living Will Sever Die 77 that everybody must join some denominational
system in order to be saved ; whereas the Scriptures plainly teach that God's purpose and plan,
during the time elapsing from the crucifixion
of the Lord to the setting up of his kingdom, is to select from amongst men his church. The
word church means called-out class. It does not
mean any denominational system. It means the
true followers of the Master who continue faithful unto death. The Apostle Paul speaks of the
church when he refers to the "church of the
firstborn, which are written in heaven".
(Hebrews 12 : 23) He does not say, Whose names
are WTitten on church books, or who have signed
pledges to contribute so much money—not the
names of those who are recorded by men, but
who are recorded by the Lord in the heavenly
records, based upon their consecration and
faithful service to him. The divine purpose is clearly set forth : "God at the first did visit the
Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the
prophets; as it is written, After this I will re- turn, and will build again the tabernacle of
David, which is fallen down; and I will build
again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up;
that the residue of men might seek after the
Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name
is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these
things."—Acts 15 : 14 - 17.
In the Scriptures a pure virgin is used to
symbolize the bride of Christ, the true church;
78 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
and an unchaste woman, or harlot, is used to symbolize the false system ; and the Lord showedthat these two would be in development side byside and that the pure virgin class would bepersecuted by the unchaste class. The LordJesus gave a parable, likening these two classes
unto wheat and tares, the true church being designated as wheat, whereas the others are designated as tares. (Matthew 13 : 24 - 39) He said
:
"Let both grow together until the harvest: andin the time of harvest I will say to the reapers,,
Gather ye together first the tares, and bind themin bundles to burn them: but gather the wheatinto my barn". The great apostate systems are binding themselves together in bundles and the
Lord is gathering his true saints unto himself.
Defining this parable Jesus said: "The goodseed are the children of the kingdom; but the
tares are the children of the wicked one; the
enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvestis the end of the world". (Matthew 13:38,39)
Further answering the question as to whatwould happen at the end of the world, he said
he would send forth his messengers with the
"sound of a trumpet [proclamation of the
truth] , and they shall gather together his elect
from the four winds, from one end of heaven[ecclesiastical systems] to the other". (Matthew24: 31) For the past forty years or more the
true Christians have been gathering themselvestogether without regard to creed or denomination, while the denominational systems are bind-
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 79 ing themselves into great compacts or leagues,
and making much fuss about converting the
world.
A CHRISTIAN'S TRIBULATION
It has become a popular matter to become a member of some church system or to join the
Interchurch World Movement; and the man or woman who contributes the greatest amount of
money is the one who receives the greatest
honor.
On the contrary, it has never been popular to be a true Christian, a true follower of Jesus;
and this is due to the fact that the divine program is: "We must through much tribulation
enter into the kingdom of God". (Acts 14:22)
Jesus said : "If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
follow me". (Matthew 16 : 24) Jesus consecrated
himself fully to do the Father's will. His footstep followers must do likewise. Jesus suffered
indignities and persecution at the hands of the
religionists of his time. His followers musthave a similar experience. "For even hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for
us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow
his steps/' (1 Peter 2:21) Jesus said: "The
disciple is not above his master, nor the servant
above his lord. It is enough for the disciple to be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If
they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his
household!" (Matthew 10 : 24, 25) Again he said
80 Millions Noiv Living Will Never Die to his followers : "If the world hate you, ye knowthat it hated me before it hated you. If ye wereof the world, the world would love his own ; butbecause ye are not of the world, but I havechosen you out of the world, therefore the worldhateth you. Eemember the word that I saidunto you, The servant is not greater than hislord. If they have persecuted me, they will alsopersecute you ; if they have kept my saying, theywill keep yours also/' (John 15 : 18 - 20) Suffering ignominy and persecution at the hands ofthe nominal religionists and the forces that theycan bring to bear, is the course clearly markedout for the true follower of Christ Jesus. "TheSpirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, thatwe are the children of God ; and if children, thenheirs ; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ
;
if so be that we suffer with him, that we maybealso glorified together." (Komans 8: 16, 17) "It
is a faithful saying : For if we be dead with him,we shall also live with him: If we suffer, weshall also reign with him/'—2 Timothy 2 : 11, 12.
The divine arrangement makes it a conditionprecedent to entering into glory that the trueChristian should be perfected through suffering.The church is but a small number, comparatively speaking; and the church, together withChrist Jesus, the head, is called to the high andexalted position in heaven, constituting the seedof Abraham according to the promise, picturedby the stars mentioned in the promise. Hence,because of this exaltation, God permits them to
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 81
be put through a period of trying circumstancesand sufferings in order that they might beafforded the opportunity of proving their faithful, loyal devotion to him. 'Tor it became him,for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to
make the captain of their salvation perfectthrough sufferings. For both he that sanctifieth
and they who are sanctified are all of one : forwhich cause he is not ashamed to call thembrethren."—Hebrews 2 : 10, 11.
True to the divine arrangement, the churchhas been put through a course of suffering. Thehead and the body members have been unjustlyaccused of crime time and again. St. Paul tells us, as likewise does the Master, that Satan is thegod of this world. (2 Corinthians 4:4) Againwe read that the whole world lieth in the wickedone. (1 John 5 : 19) The governments of earth,
therefore, have been under the dominion ofSatan, and the seed of Satan is and has been theinstrumentality he has used for the purpose ofpersecution. In the days of the Master thescribes, Pharisees, and doctors of the law, whoclaimed to sit in Moses' seat and represent Jehovah, were the ones who led the persecutionagainst the Master. Jesus plainly told thesethat they were a part of the seed of the serpent,the devil. It would be most reasonable, therefore, to expect that Satan would inject into theminds of his instruments the thought of charging the followers of Jesus with the crime of
82 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
sedition against his (Satan's) empire. The nominal religionists of his day charged Jesus with
the crime of sedition and caused him to be exe- cuted on that charge. St. Stephen, the first martyr to the cause of true Christianity following the Master, was stoned to death after being
unjustly convicted upon perjured testimony onthe charge of sedition. St. Paul, because of
his faithfulness to the Lord, was confined in
prison for four years under a similar charge andwas otherwise ill-treated. St. John the Bevelator, under a similar charge, was banished to the
isle of Patmos and required to don a prisoner's
garb and beat rock. The history of the worldshows that the true followers of Jesus have metwith opposition and persecution upon all handsand at all times.
As an illustration of this fact: the church
nominal of England became a part of the political power and those who refused to conform to the state-church were persecuted. A short distance from London stands a building erected to the memory of men who were burned upon that
spot because of their faithfulness to the truth
and who refused to conform to man-made theories of religion. John Bunyan, a humble fol- lower of Jesus, refused to be a conformist to man-made theories and he was tried and con- victed and placed in prison. A clergyman then
was delegated to wait upon him and tell Bunyanwords to this effect: You are going to be kept
in prison for three months. If at the end of
Millions Now Living Will Never Die S3 that time you recant and conform yourself to the church-state you will be released ; otherwiseyou will be put to death. And Bunyan calmlyreplied: "You might as well put me to deathnow; I will never conform". He was kept in
prison for twelve years and while there wroteBunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, which has beena great comfort and help to Christians who havetrod the narrow way from then until now. Speaking of the evidences concerning the endof the world, Jesus furthermore said: "Thenshall they deliver you [meaning his followers]
up to be afflicted, and shall kill you : and ye shall
be hated of all nations for my name's sake".
Matthew 24:9.
It is often true that advantage is taken of conditions of war and strife to vent some ill-feeling
upon others. "When the great world war began,in Germany certain Christians, known as Bible
Students, who asked to be exempted from combatant military service because of their devotion and faithfulness to the Lord and becauseof his command to them that they should notkill, were ill-treated, placed in the front ranksof battle, and were amongst the first to fall. InAustria, the very stronghold of one of the greatecclesiastical systems, a number of these sameBible Students were killed and others imprisoned during the period of the war. In Canadamany were haled into court and summarilytried without being given an opportunity to offer a defense, and were fined or imprisoned,
84 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
the charge being that they had in their possession Bibles with certain comments, hymn bookswhich they had used for years in the worship of
God, and other literature in harmony with the
Scriptures. To the astonishment of many people in the United States there was a wide persecution of conscientious followers of the Masterin this land. No Christian permits himself to become embittered because of this unjust treat- ment, but he recognizes it as a fulfillment of the
divine prophecy and one of the evidences given
by the Lord to those who yield submissively to the divine arrangement, to assure them that
they belong to him. The inspired Apostle wrote
:
"Beloved, think it not strange concerning the
fiery trial which is to try you, as though somestrange thing happened unto you: but rejoice,
inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering; that, when his glory shall be revealed,
ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If yebe reproached for the name of Christ, happyare ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth
upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified."—1 Peter 4 : 12 - 14.
Jesus and the members of his body thus developed through trial and tribulation accordingto the divine arrangement will constitute the
seed of Abraham, through which seed God will
ultimately extend blessings to all the families of
the earth. The Apostle Paul with prophetic
vision looking down through the corridors of the
age, marking the suffering of mankind and the
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 85 development of the Christ class, the seed, ex- claimed: "The whole creation groaneth and
travaileth in pain together until now, waiting
for the manifestation of the sons of God".
Eomans 8:19,22.
KINGDOM COMING IN
The wars, famine, pestilence, distress of nations, etc., upon the earth are but the forerun- ners of the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. The Lord through his prophet said: "I
will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come". (Haggai 2:7) And while
this great shaking is in progress and monarchs
are losing their crowns, aristocratic and autocratic thrones are tumbling to the earth, the
words of the prophet ring out clearly in the ears
of the followers of Jesus : "And in the days of
these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and
the kingdom shall not be left to other people,
but it shall break in pieces and consume all these
kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever".—Daniel
2:44.
Elijah was a type of the followers of Christ
Jesus; and the Lord used him to picture the
events transpiring in the end of the world, as we have heretofore mentioned. ( See pages 19-22
)
In fulfillment of the antitype, the Elijah class
knew that the war was coming and one of them,
the Lord's faithful servant, Pastor Russell, for
forty years pointed out from the prophecies that
86 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
it would come in 1914. The Lord is not in thewar, meaning that the Lord's kingdom is notyet in full sway. Then follows the earthquake,symbolic of revolution, which has already sweptsome of the countries. Then shall follow theanarchy—destructive troubles. Anarchy meansa disregard of all law, certain classes assumingto exercise power and authority where it is notgranted, causing indescribable suffering andsorrow. In this the Lord is not, but it is anothermeans of clearing away the ground preparatoryto establishing the kingdom. Then Elijah heardthe still small voice. This still small voice is a message from the Lord. The voice is used to
symbolize a message or messenger. The Lordhas long ago put the message in his Word theBible for the benefit of those who should live
in this hour of stress. The multitudes of earthare clamoring everywhere. They are confused
;
they are distressed. They are in sorrow, in
tears of bitterness. They are almost at their
wits' end. But if they could be heard to expresstheir hearts' sincere desire now, without a doubtthere would come up from every quarter of the
earth this request: Give us a government of
righteousness with a wise ruler who will administer the laws in behalf of all ; give us peace andnot war ; give us plenty and not profiteers ; give us liberty and not license ; give us life and notsuffering and death. Back from the past comesthe sweet small voice of the Lord saying that
this request shall be fulfilled : "For unto us a
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 87
child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
government shall be "upon his shoulder : and his
name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, Themighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince
of Peace. Of the increase of his governmentand peace there shall be no end, upon the throne
of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with
justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal
of the Lord of hosts will perform this."—Isaiah
9:6,7.
THE JUBILEE
An understanding of the jubilee system whichJehovah inaugurated with Israel throws a great
light upon the immediate future events. TheScriptures clearly show that Israel, while Goddealt with them for more than eighteen centuries, was a typical people. Their law was typical, foreshadowing greater and better things to come. The Lord commanded Moses to institute
the Sabbath system the year that Israel entered
the land of Canaan, which was 1575 years before
A. D. 1 (Leviticus 25:1-12), and that every
fiftieth year should be unto them a year of
jubilee. This was done on the tenth day of the
seventh month, the day of atonemont. "And ye
shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom throughout the land unto all the inhabitants
thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye
shall return every man unto his possessions andye shall return every man unto his family."
Other Scriptures show that there were to be
88 Millions Now Living Will Neve?- Dieseventy jubilees kept. (Jeremiah 25:11; 2Chronicles 36: 17 - 21) A simple calculation ofthese jubilees brings us to this important fact
:
Seventy jubilees of fifty years each would be atotal of 3500 years. That period of time beginning 1575 before A. D. 1 of necessity would endin the fall of the year 1925, at which time thetype ends and the great antitype must begin.What, then, should we expect to take place f Inthe type there must be a full restoration ; therefore the great antitype must mark the beginning of restoration of all things. The chiefthing to be restored is the human race to life
;
and since other Scriptures definitely lix the factthat there will be a resurrection of Abraham,Isaac, Jacob and other faithful ones of old, andthat these will have the first favor, we may ex-pect 1925 to witness the return of these faithfulmen of Israel from the condition of death, beingresurrected and fully restored to perfect humanity and made the visible, legal representatives of the new order of things on earth.
Messiah's kingdom once established, Jesusand his glorified church constituting the greatMessiah, shall minister the blessings to thepeople they have so long desired and hoped forand prayed might come. And when that timecomes, there will be peace and not war, as theprophet beautifully states : "In the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of thehouse of the Lord shall be established in the topof the mountains, and it shall be exalted above
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 89
the hills; and people shall flow nnto it. Andmany nations shall come, and say, Come, and
let ns go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach ns of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word
of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge
among many people, and rebuke strong nations
afar off; and they shall beat their swords into
plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks
;
nation shall not life up a sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more. But they
shall sit every man under his vine and under his
iig tree ; and none shall make them afraid ; for
the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it." —Micah4:l-4.
EARTHLY RULERS
As we have heretofore stated, the great jubi- Xlee cycle is due to begin in 1925. At that time Xthe earthly phase of the kingdom shall be recognized. The Apostle Paul in the eleventh chapter
of Hebrews names a long list of faithful menwho died before the crucifixion of the Lord and
before the beginning of the selection of the
church. These can never be a part of the heavenly class ; they had no heavenly hopes ; but God
has in store something good for them. They are
to be resurrected as perfect men and constitute
the princes or rulers in the earth, according to his promise. (Psalm 45 : 16 ; Isaiah 32 : 1 ; Matthew 8:11) Therefore we may confidently ex- pect that 1925 will mark the return of Abraham,
4
90 Millions Notv Living Will Never DieIsaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old,particularly those named by the Apostle inHebrews chapter eleven, to the condition ofhuman perfection.
RECONSTRUCTION
All the statesmen of the world, all the politicaleconomists, all the thoughtful men and women,recognize the fact that the conditions existingprior to the war have passed away and that anew order of things must be put in vogue. Allsuch recognize that this is a period now markingthe beginning of reconstruction. The great diffi- culty is that these men are exercising onlyhuman wisdom and have ignored the divine ar-rangement. We are indeed at the time of reconstruction, the reconstruction not only of a fewthings, but of all things. The reconstructionwill not consist of patching up old and brokendown systems and forms and arrangements, butthe establishment of a new and righteous oneunder the great ruler Christ Jesus, the Princeof Peace. The Apostle Peter at Pentecost,speaking under divine inspiration, and referringto that time, said: "Times of refreshing shallcome from the presence of the Lord; and heshall send Jesus Christ, which before waspreached unto you : whom the heaven must re-ceive [retain] until the times of restitution ofall things, which God hath spoken by the mouthof all his holv prophets since the world began".—Acts 3:19-21.
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 91 Examination of the prophecies from Moses to
John discloses the fact that every one of the
prophets foretold the time coming for restitution blessings. Beconstruction and restitution
mean the same thing—i. e., the restoration of
mankind to the things which were lost. The re- ward of the church in heaven is not that which
man originally had ; but is given as a great re- ward for faithfulness to the Lord under trying
conditions and circumstances. Eestitution
means the blessings that will be given to mankind in general through the divine arrangement
and therefore restoring him to life, liberty andhappiness on the earth, once enjoyed by the perfect man Adam and which was included in the
promise made to Abraham. This blessing comes
to the world through the seed, the exalted, elect
class, the Messiah, the Christ.
The Scriptures clearly show that this great
time of blessing is immediately preceded by a
great time of trouble. This trouble is now on
the world. The word Michael used in the fol- lowing text means "who as God", or representing God—Christ Jesus, the great captain of our
salvation. His second coming and the establishment of his kingdom has been the hope anddesire of Christians for centuries past. In re- ferring to this time, then, the prophet Daniel
under inspiration wrote: "And at that time
shall Michael stand up, the great prince which
standeth for the children of thy people: and
there shall be a time of trouble, such as never
92 Millions A old Living Will Never Diewas since there was a nation even to that sametime: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written inthe book. And many of them that sleep in thedust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting con-tempt."—Daniel 12 : 1, 2. MILLIONS WILL NEVER DIE
Every part of the divine arrangement must befulfilled; not" one jjot or tittle shall pass awayunfulfilled. Every portion of the divine promise, therefore, is important. Answering thequestion as to the conditions prevailing at theend of the world, Jesus quoted the above prophetic statement from the Book of Daniel, orused words similar, saying: "Then shall begreat tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor evershall be. And except those days should beshortened, there should no flesh be saved: butfor the elect's sake those days shall be shortened." (Matthew 24 : 21, 22) Thus he shows thatthe distress upon the earth will end with a timeof tribulation such as the world has never knownand that this will be the last. There will neverbe another. Then he adds that for the sake ofthe elect those days shall be shortened; andmuch flesh shall be saved.
We ask, Why would the Lord carry throughthis time of trouble a large number of people,sparing them from death in the time of trouble,unless he intended to minister unto them some
Millions Note Living Will Never Die 93
particular blessing? And since God has promiseda blessing of restitution to that which Adamlost, and since these promises point to a beginning of fulfillment immediately following this
trouble, and since the promise clearly is that the
elect, constituting the seed of Abraham, according to the promise, shall be the instrumentsthrough which the blessings shall flow, then this
statement of Jesus clearly and conclusively
proves that many peoples living on earth at the
end of the trouble will be the first ones to beoffered the blessings of restoration, which blessings will be offered through the elect, the Messiah. It follows as a matter of course that thoseaccepting the offer as made and rendering themselves in obedience to it shall be restored to that
which was lost in Adam, viz., life, liberty andhappiness.
The prophet of God offers other testimony in
corroboration of this: "And it shall come to
pass, that in all the land, saith the Lord, twoparts therein shall be cut off and die; but the
third shall be left therein. And I will bring the
third part through the fire, and will refine themas silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried : they shall call on my name, and I will hearthem : I will say, It is my people : and they shall
say, The Lord "is my God/' (Zechariah 13: 8, 9)
Here, then, is a clear statement to the effect that one part God will spare in this time of trouble
and that these shall ultimately be his people andhe will be their God.
94 Millions Note Living Will Never DieHaving in mind that it was an earthly home,human life and attendant blessings, that Adamlost, and that these are the blessings God promises shall be restored to man, we can understandthe words of the prophet David when he wrote:
"Blessed is he that considereth the poor: theLord will deliver him in time of trouble. TheLord will preserve him, and keep him alive;and he shall be blessed upon the earth ; and thouwilt not deliver him unto the will of his ene-mies/' (Psalm 41: 1, 2) Here he plainly statesthat those who deal righteously in this time oftrouble shall be blessed upon the earth.
HOW TO LIVE FOREVER
The church systems would have the peoplebelieve that only those who become church members can be saved. The Bible never taught anysuch doctrine. The Lord never organized thenominal systems, and the true church is but alittle flock, who shall inherit the kingdom ofheaven, and the others of the world do not inherit it. To the church Jesus said : "Fear not,little flock ; for it is your Father's good pleasureto give you the kingdom". (Luke 12 : 32) Jesusdied not only for those who will constitute themembers of the church, but for all. St. Johnplainly stated: "He is the propitiation [satisfaction] for our sins : and not for ours only, butalso for the sins of the whole world".—1 John2:2.
The Apostle Paul, discussing the great Eeideemer and his office, said ; "We see Jesus, who
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 95 was made a little lower than the angels for the
suffering of death, crowned with glory and
honor ; that he by the grace of God should taste
death for every man. For it became him, for
whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings." (Hebrews 2 : 9, 10) Thus we see that
Jesus died for every man, not only for a few.
Again says the Apostle : "There is one God, and
one mediator between God and men, the manChrist Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for
all, to be testified in due time". (1 Timothy 2 : 5,
6) By this Scripture it is clearly seen that in
God's due time every creature must hear the
testimony as to what Jesus has done for him
and know of the plan of salvation. Again says
the Apostle Paul: "The gift of God is eternal
life through Jesus Christ our Lord". (Romans
6:23) There can be no gift without both a giver
and a receiver, and this could not operate without knowledge on the part of both. In other
words, the giver must intelligently offer the gift to another, and the other must intelligently knowof this fact before he can receive it. It would
be impossible for the human race, therefore, to
accept the gift of life everlasting before it is offered. It will be offered only in God's due
time and the divine plan shows that his due time
is after the seed of promise is developed, after
the kingdom is set up ; and then each one in his
order will be brought to a knowledge of the fact
96 Millions Now Living Will Never Die
that a plan of redemption exists and that theway is open for him to accept the terms of it and live. Knowledge being essential, it precedesthe reception of blessings from the Lord; andknowing this fact, it is easy to be seen why theadversary, the devil, and his agencies so dili- gently strive to prevent the people from knowing the truth. But when Messiah's kingdom is established we are definitely informed (Revelation 20:1-4) that Satan will be restrained ofhis power that he might deceive the nations nomore ; and then the people shall know the truthand nothing shall hinder them from knowing it. POSITIVE PROMISE
The words of Jesus must be given full forceand effect because he spake as never man spake.His speech was with absolute authority. AndinGod's due time his words must have a fulfill- ment, and they cannot have a fulfillment until
that due time. Jesus plainly said : '"Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying,he shall never see death". (John 8:51) Asabove stated, no one could keep the saying ofJesus until he hears it, until he has a knowledgeof God's arrangement. Throughout the Gospelage none but Christians have had this knowledgeand all who have kept this saying and keep it faithfully until the end will receive life everlasting on the divine plane. (Revelation 2 : 10) Theremainder of mankind have not heard it ; therefore could not keep it. They will hear, however,
Millions Noiv Living Will Never Die 97 in due time after the establishment of the kingdom. Then it shall come to pass that every one who will keep the saying of the Lord shall never
see death. This promise would not have been
made by Jesus if he did not intend to carry it into full force and effect in due time.
Again he said: "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". (John 11:26)
Do we believe the Master's statement? If so, when the time comes for the world to knoiv, then
they who believe and, of course, render themselves in obedience to the terms have the absolute and positive statement of Jesus that they
shall never die.
Based upon the argument heretofore set forth,
then, that the old order of things, the old world,
is ending and is therefore passing away, and
that the new order is coming in, and that 1925
shall mark the resurrection of the faithful
worthies of old and the beginning of reconstruction, it is reasonable to conclude that millions
of people now on the earth will be still on the
earth in 1925. Then, based upon the promises
set forth in the divine Word, we must reach the
positive and indisputable conclusion that millions now living will never die. Of course, it does not mean that every one will
live; for some will refuse to obey the divine
law; but those who have been evil and turn
again to righteousness and obey righteousness
shall live and not die. Of this we have the positive statement of the Lord's prophet, as follows
:
98 Millions Now Living Will Never Die"When the wicked man turneth away fromhiswickedness that he hath committed, and doetlithat which is lawful and right, he shall save hissoul alive. Because he considereth, and turnethaway from all his transgressions that he hathcommitted, he shall surely live, he shall not die."—Ezekiell8:27,28.
RETURNING YOUTH
The Lord, in the exercise of his loving-kind-ness toward man, has graciously given manyillustrations and pictures of the outworkingsofhis great plan. In the hook of Job he givesusa picture of the perfection of man, of his fall, ofthe redemption by the great Bansomer, and thenthe subsequent restoration. When the timesofrestoration begin there will doubtless be manymen on the earth who will be very old and almostready for the tomb. But those who learn of thegreat ransom-sacrifice and who accept the Bansomer shall return to the days of their youth;they shall be restored to perfection of bodyandmind and live on the earth forever. We note thewords of the prophet:
"He [Jehovah] keepeth back his [man's] soulfrom the pit, and his life from perishing bythesword. He [man] is chastened also with painupon his bed, and the multitude of his boneswith strong pain: so that his life abhorrethbread, and his soul dainty meat. His flesh isconsumed away, that it cannot be seen ; andhisbones that were not seen stick out. Yea, his soul
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 99 draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
destroyers."
Thus is given a vivid description of the dying
human race, individually and collectively. Then
the prophet shows how the message of truth will
be brought to him and he will learn of the great
ransom-sacrifice. Continuing, he says: "If
there be a messenger [one who brings a message of glad tidings] with him [man], an interpreter [one who expounds and makes it clear], one among a thousand [the Lord will provide
here and there teachers for the benefit of others], to show unto man his [the Lord's] uprightness: then he [the Lord] is gracious unto him
[man] , and saith, Deliver him from going down
to the pit [grave ; and the man joyfully says :] I have found a ransom. His flesh shall be fresher
than a child's : he shall return to the days of his
youth/'—Job 33:18-25.
When God expelled Adam from Eden he said
:
"And now, lest he [Adam] put forth his hand,
and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and
live for ever : therefore the Lord God sent him
forth from the garden of Eden, . . . and he
placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every
way, to keep the way of the tree of life". (Genesis 3 : 22 - 24) Thus the Word shows that had
Adam remained in Eden, feeding upon the perfect food it afforded, he would have continued to
live. The judgment was executed against him
by causing him to feed upon imperfect food.
100 Millions Now Living Will Never DiePerfect food, therefore, seems a necessary ele-ment to sustain human life everlastingly. Whenthe kingdom of Messiah is inaugurated, thegreat Messiah will make provision for rightfood conditions.
Thus, when restoration begins, a man of sev-enty years of age will gradually be restored toa condition of physical health and mental bal-ance. The Lord will teach him how to eat, whatto eat, and other habits of life ; and above all, thetruth, and how to think and how to fix his mindupon holy things. And by the gradual processof restoration he will be lifted up by the greatMediator and restored to the days of his youthand live on the earth forever and never seedeath.
RESURRECTION
Not only will those living on the earth whenrestoration begins have the opportunity of life,but all the dead shall be awakened and broughtback in their regular order and likewise be givenan opportunity for life. It was the great Masterwho declared : "Marvel not at this : for the houris coming, in the which all that are in the gravesshall hear his voice, and shall come forth".(John 5 : 28,29) St. Paul plainly says : "Thereshall be a resurrection of the dead, both of thejust and unjust". (Acts 24:15) In his clear,forceful and logical argument set out in 1 Corinthians 15, St. Paul conclusively proves thatthe resurrection of Jesus Christ is a guaranteethat every one of the dead shall be awakened
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 101 and brought to a knowledge of the truth. Thenhe says: "He [God] hath appointed a day, in
the which he will judge the world in righteous- ness by that man whom he hath ordained;
whereof he hath given assurance unto all men,
in that he hath raised him from the dead" (Acts
17: 31) ; thus showing that during the reign of
the Messiah every one shall have one fair andimpartial opportunity for the blessings of life,
ribert}^ and happiness.
The brave young men who went to war anddied upon the battlefield have not gone to heaven, nor to eternal torture, as the creeds of Christendom would make their loved ones believe. Theyhave not shed their bodies and gone floating
about in space, as the spiritists would make menbelieve. They are dead, waiting for the resurrection; and in due time they shall be brought
back to the condition of life and restored to their
loved ones and be given a full opportunity to accept the terms of the new order of things andlive forever.
Many a good mother has spent sleepless nights
and wept tears of bitterness because of her loved one that died upon the battlefield. Many a
sweetheart, many a father, many a child, has
likewise been bowed down in sorrow because of
the great suffering that the war, trouble anddeath entailed upon the people.
CLERGY'S OPPORTUNITY
What a wonderful opportunity the clergy have
102 Millioivs Now Living Will Never Diehad and neglected during the past five years ofdistress ! Instead of misleading the people intoerroneous ways, where they have found sorrowreigning in the home because of the death ofloved ones, because of the loss upon the battlefield of some dear one, what a splendid opportunity to call attention to the precious promises ofthe Scriptures! For instance, to say to theweeping mother: "Thus saith the Lord: . . . Kefrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyesfrom tears; for thy work shall be rewarded,saith the Lord ; and they shall come again fromthe land of the enemy. And there is hope inthine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shallcome again to their own border." (Jeremiah31: 15 - 17) The land of the enemy is the landof death, because death is the great enemy ; andthe Lord will call back all who have gone intothat condition, and during his reign he will destroy death.—1 Corinthians 15 : 25, 26.
APPEAL TO THE CLERGY
It is not my thought to hold up the clergy toridicule, but rather would I appeal to them thatthey fulfill their duty and obligation to the people in this hour of distress. I would remindthem that the commission given to all followersof Jesus is not to convert the world and bringthem into some organized system. Their commission is not to collect money from the peopleto carry out these purposes. Their commissionis not to persecute others. But their divinely
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 103 given commission is plainly set forth, by the
Lord in these words : "The Spirit of the LordGod is npon me ; because the Lord hath anointed
me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he
hath sent me to bind np the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening
of the prison to them that are bonnd; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the
day of vengeance of onr God ; to comfort all that
monrn ; to appoint onto them that mourn in Zion,
to give nnto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy
for mourning, the garment of praise for the
spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord,
that he might be glorified/'—Isaiah 61 : 1 - 3. Xever was there such a time to bind up the
brokenhearted; never such a time to comfort
those that mourn, as now. Why not tell the
people the beautiful, wonderful truths contained
in the Bible and thereby enable them to look
beyond the distress that afflicts mankind, to the
new day that is coming in when life, liberty,
happiness and blessings will be offered to all mankind
!
GREAT JOY COMING
It was life, liberty and happiness that Adampossessed and lost. These things Jesus purchased by his own blood. In the time of his
reign he will give liberty to all the prisoners in
the prison-house of death and under the domination of the adversary, as beautifully declared by
the prophet, thus establishing full liberty in the
104 Millions Now Living Will Never Dieearth: "Behold my servant, whom I uphold;mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth ; I haveput my spirit upon him: he shall bring forthjudgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, norlift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in thestreet. A bruised reed shall he not break, andthe smoking flax shall he not quench: he shallbring forth judgment unto truth. He shall notfail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth : and the isles shall wait for hislaw. Thus saith God the Lord, he that createdthe heavens, and stretched them out; he thatspread forth the earth, and that which comethout of it ; he that giveth bread unto the peopleupon it, and spirit to them that walk therein : Ithe Lord have called thee in righteousness, andwill hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and givethee for a covenant of the people, for a light ofthe Gentiles ; to open the blind eyes, to bring outthe prisoners from the prison, and them that sitin darkness out of the prison-house."—Isaiah42:1-7.
We have heretofore set forth how the Lord willminister life everlasting to all the obedient onesunder his glorious reign. And when these fa-vors are returned it will indeed be a time ofhappiness—a happiness that will come to stay.God's prophet, looking down to that time, underinspiration of the Holy Spirit, wrote : "The ran-somed of the Lord [the whole human race] shallreturn [from the condition of bondage to sin anddeath], and come to Zion [the Messiah] with
Millio7is Noiv Living Will Never Die 105 songs and everlasting joy upon their heads : theyshall obtain joy and gladness, ana sorrow andsighing shall flee away".—Isaiah 35 : 10.
Then the prophet *n beautiful phrase pictures
how the earth itself shall become a fit habitationfor man. The wilderness and the solitary placewill blossom as the rose, and streams shall breakforth in the desert; the earth will yield its increase, and everything in the earth give praiseto God for the fulfillment of his wonderfulpromises.
This is the Golden Age of which the prophetsprophesied and of which the Psalmist sang ; andit is the privilege of the student of the divine
Word today, by the eye of faith, to see that weare standing at the very portals of that blessedtime! Let us look up and lift up our heads.Deliverance is at the door!
GLORIOUS CLIMAX
The Messiah, the Christ in glory, will constitute the new invisible ruling power; therefore
designated in the Scriptures as the new heaven.The righteous government organized in the
earth will constitute what the Scriptures symbolically speak of as the new earth—the earthly
phase of the Lord's kingdom. St. Peter stated
that the faithful ones, according to God's promise, look for such "new heavens and a new earth,
wherein dwelleth righteousness".—2 Peter 3 : 13.
When John the Eevelator was serving his sen- tence on the isle of Patmos, our Lord showed
106 Millions Note Living Will Never Die
approval of him and visited him and graciouslygranted to him a marvelous vision, which is re- corded as a part of the Holy Scriptures. Withecstasy that inspired witness of the Lord wrote
:
"And I saw a new heaven [invisible rulingpower] and a new earth [organized society]
:
for the first heaven and the first earth [the old
order] were passed away; and there was nomore sea. And I John saw the holy city [the
kingdom of Messiah], new Jerusalem, comingdown from God out of heaven, prepared as abride adorned for her husband. And I hearda great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the
tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwellwith them, and they shall be his people, and Godhimself shall be with them, and be their God.And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes ; and there shall be no more death, neithersorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be anymore pain: for the former things are passedaway. And he that sat upon the throne said,
Behold, I make all things new. And he said
unto me, Write: for these words are true andfaithful."—Bevelation 21 : 1 - 5. No one can gainsay this positive and conclusive promise that under the Messiah's reigndeath shall be destroyed, and sorrow, sighingand crying shall cease, and that all who areobedient shall be restored to life, liberty andhappiness. And since the old order is passingaway and the new is coming in, we can with confidence proclaim the glad message that millions
Millions Now Living Will Never Die 107 now living on the earth will be granted the opportunity for life everlasting and those whoobey shall never die, but shall be restored andlive in happiness, joy and peace upon the earthforever.
The following Scriptures, compiled by C. J. Woodworth, tend to substantiate the foregoing presentations
:
GENESIS
1 : 26. God designs that man shall have the dominion of earth. He does not have that dominion yet, as explained in Hebrews 2 : 8,
9, and he cannot have it until the Life-Giver returns and gives it. 1 : 28. If it is God's purpose to fill the earth with a race that
shall be all righteous, as declared by the prophet, Isaiah 60 : 21. The basin of the xlmazon is so rich that nothing but a population of swarming billions could ever subdue the rank vegetation. 2 : 2, 3. It was the divine plan that man should have six one- thousand-year days of toil under the great taskmaster, Sin, to be
followed by a seventh one-thousand-year day of rest from it. This
is here foreshadowed.
2 : 8, 9. This is a picture of what the whole world is to become. The work we now see everywhere going on about us, of beautifying the earth, is part of the preparation for Messiah's reign. 3 : 15. The Messiah is to have the power to destroy Satan and
all the works of Satan, one of which is death. When Messiah reigns, Satan will no longer have power to lead men into sin and death. 3 : 21. This looks forward to the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, and thus to provision for redeeming man from the curse of death. 3 : 22 - 24. God purposes that man shall live forever upon earth. 4 : 4. Abel's sacrifice looked forward to the all-sufficient one. 4 : 8. Abel's death represented the death of the Christ ; it is the death of these that makes the future blessings sure. 8 : 21. In the passing over from "this present evil world" to "the world to come" God will not smite all, but will save some alive. 9 : 11. All flesh shall not be cut off again. 9 : 15. Again, "Millions now living will never die". 12 : 3. When the due time comes for blessing all the families of the earth, those then living will be due for a blessing also. 13 : 15, 16. Some are promised an everlasting earthly inheritance. 13 : 17. Abraham's promised inheritance is to be on the earth. 15 : 7 - 21. The word here rendered "whereby" conveys the thought of, "Please give me all the information available on the
subject." The Lord answered in signs which we summarize
:
Eleven symbolic years, the combined ages of these animals, equal
3,960 literal years. They begin to count, as appears from Genesis 16 : 3, "after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan"
and this, as the Bible chronology shows, was about October 1, 2,030
B. C. 2,035i years brings us down to the A. D. period and 1,924|
brings us to the full end of the 3,960. 1,924 full years of the A.
D. period will end December 31, 1924 A. D. and f years more ends
about October 1, 1925 A. D., at which time there is reason to believe that Abraham will come into possession of his inheritance. The attendant phenomena seem to suggest that the vision will be
fulfilled during the time of trouble, pictured by the "smoking
furnace" ; at a time when the Lord Jesus will be present in his second advent as the light of the world, pictured as a "burning
108 BiMe Citations in Substantiation
lamp". As ten is a symbol of national completeness the ten nations here mentioned seem to represent all the nations of the earth. 17 : 8. The everlasting inheritance of Abraham and his posterity
is to be on earth. As some will never die and the time for them to appear is near it is reasonable to infer that co-inheritors now living
will never die, and there are millions of them. 17 : 17 - 19. The name of Isaac, meaning "laughter" ; the fact
thai; he typified the Christ, as explained in Galatians 4 : 28 ; and
the fact that he was the blesser of all his brethren, as here prophesied, prove that there will come a time when millions will never die. 18 : 18. All the nations of the earth, including the dead nations are here promised a blessing, implying their resurrection. When that time comes the living will be blessed with opportunities for life also. 19 : 17 - 22. As Lot and his two daughters were delivered from
the destruction of literal Sodom and given a little city to live in. so it may be that many will be delivered from the destruction of churchianity, "that city which is spiritually called Sodom", Revelation 11 : 8, and permitted to live on into the new order of things. 21 : 14 - 19. The hopes of the world are knit up with the hopes
of fleshly Israel, whom Ishmael represented, even as Isaac repre- sented spiritual Israel. The hopes of Zionists were revived at the great Hippodrome meeting in 1910 when Pastor Russell delivered
his address on Zionism in Prophecy to 5,500 Jews. Here the anti- typical Ishmael, ready to die of thirst, was supplied with just the water of life most needed. This is a sign of the early approach
Of returning favor to the Jew, now manifest in Zionism. 22 : 7, 8, 13. The lamb caught in the thicket represented Jesus, the blesser of all the living and the dead. 22 : 18. The living nations will participate in these blessings. 25 : 1 - 4. Keturah represented the New Covenant, God's means
for fulfilling the Abrahamic Covenant and blessing all mankind. She had six sons, representing that her offspring, at first, are imperfect. But she had ten grandsons, symbol of national completeness,
symbolizing that, in the end, the whole world will own the New Cov- enant as their source of life, and by it will reach perfection. 26 : 3. The living nations will participate in these blessings. 28 : 12. A vision of our Lord Jesus in his capacity as the Savior
of mankind, bringing blessings of life to all, living and dead. 28 : 14. The living families will participate in these blessings. 35 : IS. The fact that we now see the time of nominal Zion's
travail argues that the time for the blessing of mankind is near. Benjamin, in a way, brought blessings to his other brethren. 45 : 3 - 5. This revelation of Joseph to his brethren prior to his blessing of them represents the second advent of our Lord now
being gradually revealed to the world to their ultimate joy. 49 : 10. Shiloh is Christ, the Prince of Peace, the peacemaker
between heaven and earth. When he begins to draw all men unto
himself it will include the millions now living as well as the dead. 50 : 17. This represents the spirit of prayer and supplication as it will shortly be poured out upon millions now living. 50 : 20. As God was pleased to save much people alive at the hands of Joseph, so there is reason to believe he will be equally
pleased to save alive millions now living at the hands of Christ. EXODUS
3 : 8. This represents the purpose of the second advent of Christ
4 : 4. This represents God's purpose to lay hold upon present
evil conditions, banishing sin and death and every evil thing.
5,: 17. This sign preceding Israel's deliverance from Egypt we
now see preceding mankind's deliverance from Satan's empire.
7 : 12. This sign preceding Israel's deliverance shows how our
clear comprehension of the reason for the permission of evil com-
Bible Citations in Substantiation 109
pletely obliterates by its greater power previous explanations.
7 : 20. This sign shows how the millions of tracts setting forth the blessed harvest tidings would seem to churchianity. This sign,
fulfilled, shows that the time for earth's deliverance is near. The succeeding chapters of Exodus, down to 12 :30 inclusive, narrating the plagues successively of frogs, lice, flies, murrain,
boils, hail, locusts, darkness and the death of the firstborn, repre- sent successive manifestations of God's power in setting forth the
truth. Among the antitypes of these plagues we see the seven vol- umes of Studies in the Scriptures. The fact that these have all been
published shows that the deliverance of the world is nigh. 14 : 29,30. The passage of Israel through the Red Sea may rep- resent that some will pass through the time of anarchy alive. 15 : 13. This applies to the whole world of mankind.
15 : 26. This promise to fleshly Israel applies also to the world
of mankind in the end of the gospel age. 10 : 21. As the Israelites gathered the manna fresh every morning so the world in the new age will need to seek supplies of grace
to live. This will apply to those living when the day of grace dawns.
16 : 23. It was the divine plan that man should have a great Sabbath day for recovery of living and dead from sin and death. 19 ?10, 11. This third day represents the early morning of the
third thousand-year day beginning with the thousand-year day in which the ransom was provided for the living as well as the dead. 20 : 8 - 10. The Sabbath day typified the great thousand-year Sabbath day of restitution for the living as well as the dead. 28 : 33. The bells of gold represent that when the King shall come the fruits of his redemptive work will be manifest to all. 32 : 34. This leading of the people into the promised land rep- resents the leading back of all who will into harmony with God. 34 : 30. The bright-shining of which Israel was afraid represents the time of trouble which the world will not be able to endure. Following this the greater than Moses, Christ, will speak to the living and the dead through the medium of the vail, the Ancient Worthies. LEYITICFS
9 : 23. This appearance of the glory of the Lord unto all the
people represented the time soon coming when "the glory of the Lord
[his love for all men, living and dead] shall be revealed" to all. 13 : 2. This represents the arrangement of the Lord for the
healing of all mankind, living and dead, from sin, in the new age. 14:4. The cedar wood represents the everlasting life that may
be obtained by living and dead in the Millennial age, the scarlet the blood of the ransom, the hyssop the cleansing Word.
14 : 12. The trespass offerings represent the means of reconcilia- tion shortlv to be opened for the living as well as the dead. 15 : 5. Those who will keep the new laws may live everlastingly. 23 : 3. The Sabbath day typified the great thousand-year Sabbath dav of recovery of the living and dead from sin and death. 25 : 10.

message, a devilish message, and the people heeded them instead of heeding the truth, but it may well be that, literally, they and their systems shall fail to enter in, while their children, literally, shall have the promised inheritance. It may be that these worldly
systems will go down in the fall of 1921. Or the forty years may be viewed as beginning with the proclamation of the harvest message
in 1878 and ending with the beginning of the downfall of ecclesias- ticism, which took place in Russia in 1918. 19 : 9. These ashes of the red heifer, kept for the cleansing of the people from sin, represent the remembrance of the faithfulness

33 : 14 - 30. Elihu, not one of the three contenders with Job that were reproved by the Almighty, but a fourth one whose utterances seem to have been guided by the Loi'd, calls attention to the fact that God has repeatedly warned mankind during this night time of
evil ; that man has seen strange visions upon his creed bed throughout this period, but now that we are in the day of wrath he is getting his eyes and ears open. No longer shall men be permitted
to follow their own plans. Then follows the history of a man that
is sick, his pains, his failing appetite, his loss of flesh, all suggest- ing his speedy dissolution. Then he explains that if the time has come for the second advent of the Lord, the Messenger of the Covenant, God's interpreter of his own character, the fairest among ten thousand, God is gracious unto the sick one and says, in substance "He need not die, the ransom has been applied for' him ; if he will repent of his sins he may grow young again and live forever." 38 : 11 - 15.

all things stand as though newly clad". All things shall be made
new ; death shall be no more.
