Does Rutherford say anything about the source of his interpretation?



Assistant
J.F. Rutherford, in his booklet *Millions Now Living Will Never Die*, bases his interpretations primarily on a literal and prophetic reading of the Bible. He considers the Bible to be the ultimate source of authority and understanding for events past, present, and future. Rutherford's interpretations are deeply rooted in a dispensational view, which sees history as divided into distinct epochs as part of God’s divine plan.



Though Rutherford uses historical events and contemporary occurrences of his time (such as the return of Jews to Palestine and global unrest post-World War I) to substantiate his interpretations, he does not claim any external or supernatural revelation outside of his understanding of Biblical scripture. His perspective is aligned with the teachings and beliefs he espoused as a leader within the International Bible Students Association, which later became known as Jehovah’s Witnesses.



Rutherford does not present his interpretations as personal revelations, but rather as logical and prophetic conclusions drawn from his intensive study and reading of the Bible, as well as the writings and sermons of his predecessor, Pastor Charles Taze Russell.

Does he expect a certain date for certain future events, as prophecies, in this book?

If yes, give me quotes and chapters.



Assistant
Yes, J.F. Rutherford does predict specific future events and assigns particular dates to them in *Millions Now Living Will Never Die*. Notably, he focuses on the year 1925 as a significant prophetic milestone.



Here are some relevant quotes and their respective chapters:



1. **Chapter 8: Zionism, Its Origin and Purpose**

   - Rutherford anticipates the return and gathering of the Jews to Palestine as a significant prophetic event tied to biblical expectations, which he sees as aligning with historical developments leading up to the time of his writing.



2. **Chapter 22: Israel's Jubilee System a Type of the Kingdom**

   - "Seventy jubilees of fifty years each would be a total of 3500 years. That period of time beginning 1575 before A. D. 1 of necessity would end in the fall of the year 1925, at which time the type ends and the great antitype must begin."

   - Here, he interprets the Jubilee system of ancient Israel as a typological prophecy culminating in significant restoration events around 1925.



3. **Chapter 24: Why Millions Now Living Will Not Die**

   - He claims that there are people alive in his time who will never experience death because they will live to see the unfolding of prophetic promises: "Based upon the argument heretofore set forth, then, that the old order of things, the old world, is ending and is therefore passing away, and that the new order is coming in, and that 1925 shall mark the resurrection of the faithful worthies of old and the beginning of reconstruction..."



Rutherford's interpretation is very much focused on the year 1925 as a pivotal moment in biblical prophecy, particularly concerning the resurrection of biblical figures and the inauguration of God's Kingdom on Earth. These predictions are integral to the central thesis of the book, namely that "millions now living will never die," presupposing the arrival of an age where death will be abolished for those faithful.

Did anything happen in 1925 that would prove his expectations as true?



Assistant
In 1925, nothing occurred that would substantiate J.F. Rutherford's specific prophetic expectations as outlined in *Millions Now Living Will Never Die*. Rutherford had predicted that 1925 would mark the resurrection of the faithful worthies of old, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the beginning of significant earthly blessings under God's Kingdom. These events did not transpire.



The lack of fulfillment of these expectations is acknowledged within the history of Jehovah's Witnesses, formerly known as the International Bible Students Association. The organization later moved away from the focus on specific dates and began emphasizing a broader understanding of end-time prophecies without fixed chronological assertions. Over time, the leadership of Jehovah's Witnesses recognized that the specific prophetic event involving the return of the ancient faithful did not happen as expected in 1925, and this led to adjustments in their doctrinal approach.
