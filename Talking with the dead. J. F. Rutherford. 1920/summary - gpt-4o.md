The book "Talking with the Dead" addresses the controversial topic of communication with the dead through a series of arguments and analyses presented by different characters. Here is a summary of each chapter based on the Table of Contents and excerpt you provided:

**Chapter I: The Colloquy**
Three gentlemen, Mr. Newday, Psychic, and Lightbearer, engage in a discussion about the possibility of communicating with the dead. Psychic and Lightbearer hold opposing views, with Psychic advocating for the possibility and Lightbearer arguing against it. They agree to present their arguments to convince Mr. Newday, who is torn due to the recent loss of his son in the war.

**Chapter II: Psychic's Argument**
Psychic argues that communication with the dead is possible and cites the experiences of prominent figures such as Professor Hyslop and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Psychic claims that a willing and open mind is essential for belief. He presents purported letters from a dead soldier to his mother as evidence of the living talking with the dead.

**Chapter III: Lightbearer's Argument**
Lightbearer presents a counter-argument that the concept of communicating with the dead is fundamentally flawed, relying on the doctrine of the soul's inherent immortality, which he disputes. He cites Biblical scriptures to assert that death is the penalty for sin and that the soul is not immortal. He argues that evil spirits or demons can deceive people into believing they are communicating with deceased loved ones.

**Chapter IV: Newday's Conclusion**
After hearing both arguments, Mr. Newday sides with Lightbearer. He concludes that the Biblical evidence supports the view that the dead are truly dead and cannot communicate with the living. The promise of future resurrection is the hope for the dead.

**Chapter V: Demon Phenomena Analyzed**
This chapter examines various spiritism phenomena reported in the press, highlighting the deceptive and destructive nature of evil spirits. These spirits are said to manipulate mediums and lead people to insanity and moral decay. The chapter emphasizes that these manifestations are not from the spirits of the deceased but are demonic deceptions.

**Chapter VI: "Spirits In Prison"**
A critical analysis of 1 Peter 3:18-20, which speaks of Jesus preaching to spirits in prison. Lightbearer interprets this to mean that the "spirits" were fallen angels, not dead humans. These angels disobeyed God in the days of Noah and were imprisoned. Jesus' death and resurrection served as a silent testimony to these spirits.

**Chapter VII: The Hope for the Dead**
The chapter explains God's plan for the restoration of humanity through Jesus' ransom sacrifice. It describes how Jesus' death provides the means for the resurrection and the eventual reconciliation of all people with God. The chapter also touches on Godâ€™s judgment of fallen angels and Satan's ongoing attempts to deceive and divert humans from God's plan. 

Overall, the book presents a religiously rooted examination of spiritualism and communication with the dead, with a strong focus on Christian doctrine and Biblical interpretation.
